INTRODUCTION: Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT) 2E/1F is caused by mutations
of the neurofilament light chain polypeptide (NEFL) gene. Giant axons are a
histological hallmark frequently seen in nerves of patients with CMT2E.
METHODS: We describe the case of a 43-year old patient with a painful
predominantly sensory neuropathy.
RESULTS: The patient's sural nerve biopsy showed multiple giant axons. Genetic
sequencing of the NEFL gene revealed that the patient was heterozygous for an
altered sequence of the gene c.816C>G, p.Asn272Lys, that has not yet been
described in CMT2E/1F.
DISCUSSION: In contrast to other cases of CMT2E/1F, where motor symptoms are
predominant, pain was the most disabling symptom in this patient. This article is

Surface interactions at the biomaterial-cellular interface determine the
proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. Manipulating such interactions
through the surface chemistry of scaffolds renders control over directed stem
cell differentiation into the cell lineage of interest. This approach is of
central importance for stem cell-based tissue engineering and regenerative
therapy applications. In the present study, silk fibroin films (SFFs) decorated
with integrin-binding laminin peptide motifs (YIGSR and GYIGSR) were prepared and
employed for in vitro adult stem cell-based neural tissue engineering
applications. Functionalization of SFFs with short peptides showcased the peptide
sequence and nature of functionalization-dependent differentiation of bone
marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Intriguingly, covalently
functionalized SFFs with GYIGSR hexapeptide (CL2-SFF) supported hMSC
proliferation and maintenance in an undifferentiated pluripotent state and
directed the differentiation of hMSCs into neuron-like cells in the presence of a
biochemical cue, on-demand. The observed morphological changes were further
corroborated by the up-regulation of neuronal-specific marker gene expression
(MAP2, TUBB3, NEFL), confirmed through semiquantitative reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The enhanced proliferation and
on-demand directed differentiation of adult stem cells (hMSCs) by the use of an
economically viable short recognition peptide (GYIGSR), as opposed to the
integrin recognition protein laminin, establishes the potential of SFFs for
neural tissue engineering and regenerative therapy applications.

INTRODUCTION: Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT) is a genetically heterogeneous
group of peripheral neuropathies. In addition to the classical clinical
phenotype, additional features can occur.
METHODS: We studied a wide range of additional features in a cohort of 49
genetically confirmed CMT patients and performed a systematic literature
revision.
RESULTS: Patients harbored a PMP22 gene alteration (n = 28) or a mutation in MPZ 
(n = 11), GJB1 (n = 4), LITAF (n = 2), MFN2 (n = 2), INF2 (n = 1), NEFL (n = 1). 
We identified four novel mutations (3 MPZ, 1 GJB1). A total of 88% presented at
least one additional feature. In MPZ patients, we detected hypertrophic nerve
roots in 3/4 cases that underwent spinal MRI, and pupillary abnormalities in 27%.
In our cohort, restless legs syndrome (RLS) was present in 18%. We describe for
the first time RLS associated with LITAF or MFN2 and predominant upper limb
involvement with LITAF. Cold-induced hand cramps occurred in 10%
(PMP22,MPZ,MFN2), and autonomous nervous system involvement in 18% (PMP22,MPZ,
LITAF,MFN2). RLS and respiratory insufficiency were mostly associated with severe
neuropathy, and pupillary abnormalities with mild to moderate neuropathy.
CONCLUSIONS: In CMT patients, additional features occur frequently. Some of them 
might be helpful in orienting genetic diagnosis. Our data broaden the clinical
spectrum and genotype-phenotype associations with CMT.

In neurons, microtubules form a dense array within axons, and the stability and
function of this microtubule network is modulated by neurofilaments. Accumulation
of neurofilaments has been observed in several forms of neurodegenerative
diseases, but the mechanisms how elevated neurofilament levels destabilize axons 
are unknown so far. Here, we show that increased neurofilament expression in
motor nerves of pmn mutant mice, a model of motoneuron disease, causes disturbed 
microtubule dynamics. The disease is caused by a point mutation in the
tubulin-specific chaperone E (Tbce) gene, leading to an exchange of the most
C-terminal amino acid tryptophan to glycine. As a consequence, the TBCE protein
becomes instable which then results in destabilization of axonal microtubules and
defects in axonal transport, in particular in motoneurons. Depletion of
neurofilament increases the number and regrowth of microtubules in pmn mutant
motoneurons and restores axon elongation. This effect is mediated by interaction 
of neurofilament with the stathmin complex. Accumulating neurofilaments associate
with stathmin in axons of pmn mutant motoneurons. Depletion of neurofilament by
Nefl knockout increases Stat3-stathmin interaction and stabilizes the
microtubules in pmn mutant motoneurons. Consequently, counteracting enhanced
neurofilament expression improves axonal maintenance and prolongs survival of pmn
mutant mice. We propose that this mechanism could also be relevant for other
neurodegenerative diseases in which neurofilament accumulation and loss of
microtubules are prominent features.

Ependymomas occur in both the brain and spine. The prognosis of these tumors
sometimes differs for different locations. The genetic landscape of ependymoma is
very heterogeneous despite the similarity of histopathologic findings. In this
review, we describe the genetic differences between spinal ependymomas and their 
intracranial counterparts to better understand their prognosis. From the
literature review, many studies have reported that spinal cord ependymoma might
be associated with NF2 mutation, NEFL overexpression, Merlin loss, and 9q gain.
In myxopapillary ependymoma, NEFL and HOXB13 overexpression were reported to be
associated. Prior studies have identified HIC-1 methylation, 4.1B deletion, and
4.1R loss as common features in intracranial ependymoma. Supratentorial
ependymoma is usually characterized by NOTCH-1 mutation and p75 expression. TNC
mutation, no hypermethylation of RASSF1A, and GFAP/NeuN expression may be
diagnostic clues of posterior fossa ependymoma. Although MEN1, TP53, and PTEN
mutations are rarely reported in ependymoma, they may be related to a poor
prognosis, such as recurrence or metastasis. Spinal ependymoma has been found to 
be quite different from intracranial ependymoma in genetic studies, and the
favorable prognosis in spinal ependymoma may be the result of the genetic
differences. A more detailed understanding of these various genetic aberrations
may enable the identification of more specific prognostic markers as well as the 
development of customized targeted therapies.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal type of primary
malignant brain tumor. In recent years, increasing reports suggest that discovery
of microRNAs (miRNAs) might provide a novel therapeutical target for human
cancers, including GBM. The expression and roles of microRNA-183 (miR-183) has
been explored in several types of human cancers, including in GBM, and plays
important roles in tumor initiation and progression. However, its biological
functions in GBM remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that
miR-183 was significantly up-regulated in astrocytoma tissues and glioblastoma
cell lines. Introduction of miR-183 mimics into U251 cells could promoted, while 
its antisense oligos inhibited cell proliferation and invasion. Moreover, we
identified neurofilament light polypeptide (NEFL) as a novel target gene of
miR-183. The expression levels of NEFL are inversely correlated with that of
miR-183 in human astrocytoma clinical specimens. In addition, NEFL-siRNA could
significantly attenuate the inhibitory effects of knockdown miR-183 on the
proliferation and invasion of U251 cells via mTOR signaling pathway. Overall,
This study revealed that miR-183 promotes glioma cell proliferation by targeting 
NEFL, and also demonstrated that miR-183 could be a potential target for GBM
treatment.

The role of NEFL in NSCLC remains largely unknown. Immunohistochemistry was
performed to investigate the expression of NEFL in 108 lung cancer specimens.
NEFL expression was associated with decreased lymph node metastases and favorable
prognosis. Furthermore, real-time PCR and Western blot were used to investigate
the expression of the NEFL gene in NSCLC cell lines. Subsequently,
lentivirus-mediated RNA interference and overexpression were used to demonstrate 
that knocked-down of NEFL enhanced the invasion and migration of A549 and H460
NSCLC cells, whereas NEFL overexpression resulted in a suppression of the
invasion and migration of GLC-82 and L78 cells in vitro. In addition, bisulfite
sequence PCR assay demonstrated that NEFL downregulation was associated with
promoter methylation, and NEFL expression was restored after treatment with
5-Aza-dC. Finally, we demonstrated that NEFL inhibited the NF-κB pathway, thereby
suppressing the expression of uPA and decreasing NSCLC invasiveness and
migration. Our studies suggest that NEFL methylation is a novel mechanism for
NSCLC invasion and metastasis and that NEFL may represent a candidate biomarker
for recurrence and survival in patients with NSCLC.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a group of hereditary peripheral neuropathies that
share clinical characteristics of progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy,
foot deformities, distal sensory loss, as well as diminished tendon reflexes.
Hundreds of causative DNA changes have been found, but much of the genetic basis 
of the disease is still unexplained. Mutations in the ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 gene
are a frequent cause of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with
thin corpus callosum and peripheral axonal neuropathy, and account for ∼ 40% of
autosomal recessive juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The overlap of axonal
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with both diseases, as well as the common autosomal
recessive inheritance pattern of thin corpus callosum and axonal
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in three related patients, prompted us to analyse the
ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 gene in affected individuals with autosomal recessive axonal 
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We investigated 28 unrelated families with autosomal
recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease defined by clinical,
electrophysiological, as well as pathological evaluation. Besides, we screened
for all the known genes related to axonal autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease (CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2, CMT2B1/LMNA, CMT2B2/MED25, CMT2B5/NEFL,
ARCMT2F/dHMN2B/HSPB1, CMT2K/GDAP1, CMT2P/LRSAM1, CMT2R/TRIM2, CMT2S/IGHMBP2,
CMT2T/HSJ1, CMTRID/COX6A1, ARAN-NM/HINT and GAN/GAN), for the genes related to
autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum and
axonal peripheral neuropathy (SPG7/PGN, SPG15/ZFYVE26, SPG21/ACP33, SPG35/FA2H,
SPG46/GBA2, SPG55/C12orf65 and SPG56/CYP2U1), as well as for the causative gene
of peripheral neuropathy with or without agenesis of the corpus callosum
(SLC12A6). Mitochondrial disorders related to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 
were also excluded by sequencing POLG and TYMP genes. An additional locus for
autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2H on chromosome 8q13-21.1
was excluded by linkage analysis. Pedigrees originated in Italy, Brazil, Canada, 
England, Iran, and Japan. Interestingly, we identified 15 ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840
mutations in 12 families (two sequence variants were never reported before,
p.Gln198* and p.Pro2212fs*5). No large deletions/duplications were detected in
these patients. The novel mutations seemed to be pathogenic since they
co-segregated with the disease in all pedigrees and were absent in 300 unrelated 
controls. Furthermore, in silico analysis predicted their pathogenic effect. Our 
results indicate that ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 is the causative gene of a wide
spectrum of clinical features, including autosomal recessive axonal
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated
with the loss of cognitive function. Neurofilament (NF) triplet proteins, the
major structural (intermediate filament) proteins of neurons, are expressed in a 
subset of pyramidal cells that show a high degree of vulnerability to
degeneration in AD. Alterations in the NF triplet proteins in amyloid-beta (Aβ)
plaque-associated dystrophic neurites (DNs) represent the first cytoskeletal
aberration to occur in the neocortex in the earliest stages of AD. We generated
transgenic APP/PS1 (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) mice on the neurofilament light knockout
(NFL KO) background to explore the role of NFL deletion in the context of DN
formation, synaptic changes, and other neuropathologic features. Our analysis
demonstrated that NFL deficiency significantly increased neocortical DN
pathology, Aβ deposition, synapse vulnerability, and microgliosis in APP/PS1
mice. Thus, NFs may have a role in protecting neurites from dystrophy and in
regulating cellular pathways related to the generation of Aβ plaques.

Maintenance of the gut epithelial integrity under stressful environments requires
epithelial cells to rapidly elicit changes in gene expression patterns to
regulate their survival, adapt to stress, and keep epithelial homeostasis.
Disruption of the intestinal epithelial integrity occurs commonly in patients
with various critical illnesses, leading to the translocation of luminal toxic
substances and bacteria to the blood stream. Recently, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs)
have emerged as a novel class of master regulators of gene expression and are
fundamentally involved in many aspects of gut mucosal regeneration, protection,
and epithelial barrier function. Here, we highlight the roles of several
intestinal epithelial tissue-specific microRNAs, including miR-222, miR-29b,
miR-503, and miR-195, and long ncRNAs such as H19 and SPRY4-IT1 in the regulation
of cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and cell-to-cell interactions and
also further analyze the mechanisms through which ncRNAs and their interactions
with RNA-binding proteins modulate the stability and translation of target mRNAs.

Influences of adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR) activity on the cardiac transcriptome 
and genesis of endotoxemic myocarditis are unclear. We applied transcriptomic
profiling (39 K Affymetrix arrays) to identify A2AR-sensitive molecules, revealed
by receptor knockout (KO), in healthy and endotoxemic hearts. Baseline cardiac
function was unaltered and only 37 A2AR-sensitive genes modified by A2AR KO
(≥1.2-fold change, <5 % FDR); the five most induced are Mtr, Ppbp, Chac1, Ctsk
and Cnpy2 and the five most repressed are Hp, Yipf4, Acta1, Cidec and Map3k2. Few
canonical paths were impacted, with altered Gnb1, Prkar2b, Pde3b and Map3k2
(among others) implicating modified G protein/cAMP/PKA and cGMP/NOS signalling.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 20 mg/kg) challenge for 24 h modified >4100 transcripts 
in wild-type (WT) myocardium (≥1.5-fold change, FDR < 1 %); the most induced are 
Lcn2 (+590); Saa3 (+516); Serpina3n (+122); Cxcl9 (+101) and Cxcl1 (+89) and the 
most repressed are Car3 (-38); Adipoq (-17); Atgrl1/Aplnr (-14); H19 (-11) and
Itga8 (-8). Canonical responses centred on inflammation, immunity, cell death and
remodelling, with pronounced amplification of toll-like receptor (TLR) and
underlying JAK-STAT, NFκB and MAPK pathways, and a 'cardio-depressant' profile
encompassing suppressed ß-adrenergic, PKA and Ca(2+) signalling,
electromechanical and mitochondrial function (and major shifts in transcripts
impacting function/injury including Lcn2, S100a8/S100a9, Icam1/Vcam and Nox2
induction, and Adipoq, Igf1 and Aplnr repression). Endotoxemic responses were
selectively modified by A2AR KO, supporting inflammatory suppression via A2AR
sensitive shifts in regulators of NFκB and JAK-STAT signalling (IκBζ, IκBα,
STAT1, CDKN1a and RRAS2) without impacting the cardio-depressant gene profile.
Data indicate A2ARs exert minor effects in un-stressed myocardium and selectively
suppress NFκB and JAK-STAT signalling and cardiac injury without influencing
cardiac depression in endotoxemia.

Gene expression from both parental genomes is required for completion of
embryogenesis. Differential methylation of each parental genome has been observed
in mouse and human preimplantation embryos. It is possible that these differences
in methylation affect the level of gene transcripts from each parental genome in 
early developing embryos. The aim of this study was to investigate if there is a 
parent-specific pattern of BRCA1 expression in human embryos and to examine if
this affects embryo development when the embryo carries a BRCA1 or BRCA2
pathogenic mutation. Differential parental expression of ACTB, SNRPN, H19 and
BRCA1 was semi-quantitatively analysed by minisequencing in 95 human
preimplantation embryos obtained from 15 couples undergoing preimplantation
genetic diagnosis. BRCA1 was shown to be differentially expressed favouring the
paternal transcript in early developing embryos. Methylation-specific PCR showed 
a variable methylation profile of BRCA1 promoter region at different stages of
embryonic development. Embryos carrying paternally inherited BRCA1 or 2
pathogenic variants were shown to develop more slowly compared with the embryos
with maternally inherited BRCA1 or 2 pathogenic mutations. This study suggests
that differential demethylation of the parental genomes can influence the early
development of preimplantation embryos. Expression of maternal and paternal genes
is required for the completion of embryogenesis.European Journal of Human

Reliable biomarkers for the detection of early ovarian carcinoma are currently
unavailable. MicroRNA and long non-coding RNA may be important in cancer
initiation and progression by regulating gene expression through
post-transcriptional mechanisms. MicroRNAs, such as miR-26a and miR-132, have
been investigated as novel biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring of
therapeutic response, and therapeutic targets in ovarian carcinomas. Some long
non-coding RNAs, such as H19 and UCA1, may be involved in the pathogenesis of
ovarian carcinomas. MicroRNA and long non-coding RNA have potential clinical
utility in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer and predicting prognosis, metastasis, 
recurrence, and response to therapy.

Recently, numerous studies indicate that H19 plays a key role in tumorigenesis,
but the results have been disputed, especially in the aspects of tumor
progression and metastasis. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to
systematically summarize the relationship between H19 and cancers. We searched
PubMed, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Chinese Wan Fang to identify eligible
studies. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to assess the
effect size. A total of 13 studies were enrolled in this meta-analysis, which was
performed by Revman5.3 and Stata11.0 software. Our meta-analysis showed that the 
expression of H19 was associated with distant metastasis in nongastrointestinal
tumors (OR = 3.85, 95% CI = 1.31-11.36, P = 0.01) and, in gastrointestinal tumors
(OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.15-0.78, P = 0.01), lymph node metastasis (OR = 2.04, 95% 
CI = 1.19-3.48, P = 0.009). Moreover, in gastric cancer, H19 expression was
significantly related to histological grade (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.29-0.86, P =
0.01), TNM stage (OR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.11-0.33, P < 0.01), and tumor invasion
depth (OR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.04-0.27, P < 0.01). Therefore, H19 could serve as a 
potential marker for progression and metastasis evaluation of cancers.

BACKGROUND: The latency-associated transcript (LAT) gene of herpes simplex virus 
(HSV)-2 is the only detectable viral gene expressed during latent infection in
neurons. LAT inhibits apoptosis and maintains latency by promoting the survival
of infected neurons. However, whether LAT functions during HSV-2 infection via
its encoded RNAs or via its encoded proteins remain unknown. Increasing evidence 
has indicated that LAT is likely to functionally promote the establishment of
latent infection via LAT-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs).
AIM: To explore whether the RL1 fragment of the five adjacent miRNAs has an
effect on cell apoptosis, then provide supporting evidence to elucidate the
potential role of these miRNAs and to aid screening of their cellular targets.
METHODS: A number of techniques, including MTT assay, flow cytometry and DNA
ladder analysis, were used to verify the role of the RL1 fragment and the
contribution of the individual miRNAs to the anti-apoptotic effect.
RESULTS: Five miRNAs (miR-H3, miR-H4-3p, miR-H4-5p, miR-H24 and miR-H19) were
detected by quantitative PCR in PC12 cells stably expressing RL1 after pEGFP-RL1 
plasmid transfection in vitro. The data indicated that expression of HSV-2 LAT
RL1 seems to provide protection against apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by ActD. 
Antisense miRNAs specifically inhibiting these five miRNAs could efficiently
reduce their expression. Transfection of antisense-miR-H3, antisense-miR-H4-5p
and antisense-miR-H19 into PC12 cells stably expressing RL1 were able to partly
reverse the anti-apoptotic effect of these miRNAs.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the apoptotic role of the RL1 fragment 
is likely to be related to overexpression of miR-H3, miR-H4-5p and miR-H19 in
PC12 cells.

BACKGROUND: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an early-onset overgrowth
disorder with a high risk for embryonal tumors. It is mainly caused by
dysregulation of imprinted genes on chromosome 11p15.5; however, the driving
forces in the development of tumors are not fully understood.
PROCEDURE: We report on a female patient presenting with macrosomia,
macroglossia, organomegaly and extensive bilateral nephroblastomatosis. Adjuvant 
chemotherapy was initiated; however, the patient developed hepatoblastoma and
Wilms tumor at 5 and 12 months of age, respectively. Subsequent radiofrequency
ablation of the liver tumor and partial nephrectomy followed by consolidation
therapy achieved complete remission.
RESULTS: Molecular genetic analysis revealed a maternally derived large deletion 
of the complete H19-differentially methylated region (H19-DMR; imprinting control
region-1 [ICR1]), the whole H19 gene itself as well as large parts of the distal 
enhancer region within the imprinting cluster-1 (IC1). Extended analysis showed
highly elevated insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) expression, possibly
explaining at least in part the distinct BWS features and tumor manifestations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study of a large maternal deletion encompassing the H19 gene
and complete ICR1 is the first to demonstrate transcriptional consequences on
IGF2 in addition to methylation effects resulting in severe overgrowth and
occurrence of multiple tumors in a BWS patient. Studying this deletion helps to
clarify the complex molecular processes involved in BWS and provides further
insight into tumorigenesis.

The H19 is a kind of long noncoding RNA, which has been implicated in multiple
biological functions. However, the associations between genetic variants in H19
and susceptibility of coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) have been seldom
reported. In the present study, three potential polymorphisms (rs2067051,
rs217727, and rs2839702) in H19 were genotyped in a case-control study including 
703 CWP cases and 705 controls. We found that individuals with the H19 rs2067051 
CT/TT genotypes showed a decreased risk of CWP compared with those with the CC
genotype (adjusted OR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.49-0.83, p = 0.001). Further stratified
analyses revealed that the associations between variant genotypes of rs2067051
and the risk of CWP were more prominent in subjects of non-smokers (adjusted OR =
0.55, 95%CI = 0.39-0.79, p = 0.001) and CWP patients with Stage I (adjusted OR = 
0.63, 95%CI = 0.46-0.86, p = 0.004). Additionally, the protective effects of H19 
rs2067051 were also evident in coal miners both with dust exposure years <25
years (adjusted OR = 0.63, 95%CI = 0.42-0.95, p = 0.026) and ≥25 years (adjusted 
OR = 0.57, 95%CI = 0.40-0.80, p = 0.001). Our results indicated that rs2067051 in
the H19 gene is correlated with a deceased risk of CWP in a Chinese population,
which may be a potential genetic marker for prevention and intervention of CWP.
Further functional studies are warranted to validate our findings.

Differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs and the prognostic potential in
colorectal cancer.

Li Q, Dai Y, Wang F, Hou S.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a disease with high incidence, especially in developed
countries. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are new research hotspots for their
vital roles in regulating gene expression. This study aims to investigate the
prognostic value of lncRNAs in CRC patients. A total of 21 cancer-related lncRNAs
were detected by PCR array to reveal their expression changes in CRC tissue. A
120-week-long follow-up was performed in 30 CRC patients to analyze the
relationship between lncRNA levels and CRC prognosis. Most of the 21 lncRNAs were
differentially expressed in CRC tissue compared to the adjacent normal tissue,
among which seven lncRNAs were significantly changed: AFAP1-AS1, BCAR4, H19,
HOXA-AS2, MALAT1 and PVT1 were up-regulated, and ADAMTS9-AS2 was down-regulated
in CRC tissue samples. No obvious correlation was found between lncRNA levels and
the age, gender, tumor size or TNM stage of these patients. Log-rank test
indicated that higher levels of AFAP1-AS1, BCAR4, H19, HOXA-AS2, MALAT1 or PVT1
and a lower level of ADAMTS9-AS2 might predict a poor prognosis of CRC patients. 
This study suggests the potential value of the seven lncRNAs in the prognosis of 
CRC, providing reference information for future research on CRC prognostic and
treatment strategy.

Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism that switches the expression of
imprinted genes involved in normal embryonic growth and development in a
parent-of-origin-specific manner. Changes in DNA methylation statuses from
polyploidization are a well characterized epigenetic modification in plants.
However, how changes in ploidy affect both imprinted gene expression and
methylation status in mammals remains unclear. To address this, we used
quantitative real time PCR to analyze expression levels of imprinted genes in
mouse tetraploid fetuses. We used bisulfite sequencing to assess the methylation 
statuses of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that regulate imprinted gene
expression in triploid and tetraploid fetuses. The nine imprinted genes H19,
Gtl2, Dlk1, Igf2r, Grb10, Zim1, Peg3, Ndn, and Ipw were all unregulated; in
particular, the expression of Zim1 was more than 10-fold higher, and the
expression of Ipw was repressed in tetraploid fetuses. The methylation statuses
of four DMRs H19, intergenic (IG), Igf2r, and Snrpn in tetraploid and triploid
fetuses were similar to those in diploid fetuses. We also performed
allele-specific RT-PCR sequencing to determine the alleles expressing the three
imprinted genes Igf2, Gtl2, and Dlk1 in tetraploid fetuses. These three imprinted
genes showed monoallelic expression in a parent-of-origin-specific manner.
Expression of non-imprinted genes regulating neural cell development
significantly decreased in tetraploid fetuses, which might have been associated
with unregulated imprinted gene expression. This study provides the first
detailed analysis of genomic imprinting in tetraploid fetuses, suggesting that
imprinted gene expression is disrupted, but DNA methylation statuses of DMRs are 
stable following changes in ploidy in mammals.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of mortality among males. Long
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are subclass of noncoding RNAs that may act as
biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this study, we firstly conducted analysis 
of global lncRNA expression patterns by using our own cohort (GSE73397) and two
public available gene expression datasets: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and
GSE55909. Next, we performed microarray to observe genome-wide lncRNAs'
expressions under dihydrotestosterone (DHT) stimulation in LNCaP cells
(GSE72866), and overlapped the result with ChIPBase data to predict
androgen-responsive lncRNAs with ARE. Combined the two results, a total of 44
androgen-responsive lncRNAs with ARE were found to be over-expressed in PCa
samples. Ten lncRNAs were selected for further validation by examining their
expressions in LNCaP cells under DHT stimulation, and in PCa samples and cell
lines. Among them, RP1-4514.2, LINC01138, SUZ12P1 and KLKP1 were validated as
directly AR-targeted lncRNAs by ChIP-PCR. Then we conducted a bioinformatic
analysis to identify lncRNAs as putative prognostic and therapeutic targets by
using TCGA data. Three androgen-responsive lncRNAs, LINC01138, SUZ12P1 and SNHG1 
showed association with gleason score and pT-stage. The biological functions of
LINC01138 and SUZ12P1 were also evaluated, both lncRNAs promoted the
proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of PCa. These results provide potent
information for exploring potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for
prostate cancer, especially for castration-resistant PCa.

Despite of the discovery of protein therapeutic targets and advancement in
multimodal therapy, the survival chance of high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) patients 
is still less than 50%. MYCN amplification is a potent driver of NB, which exerts
its oncogenic activity through either activating or inhibiting the transcription 
of target genes. Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reported to be
altered in cancers including NB. However, lncRNAs that are altered by MYCN
amplification and associated with outcome in high-risk NB patients are limitedly 
discovered. Herein, we examined the expression profiles of lncRNAs and
protein-coding genes between MYCN amplified and MYCN non-amplified NB from
microarray (n = 47) and RNA-seq datasets (n = 493). We identified 6 lncRNAs in
common that were differentially expressed (adjusted P ≤ 0.05 and fold change ≥ 2)
and subsequently validated by RT-qPCR. The co-expression analysis reveals lncRNA,
SNHG1 and coding gene, TAF1D highly co-expressed in NB. Kaplan-Meier analysis
shows that higher expression of SNHG1 is significantly associated with poor
patient survival. Importantly, multivariate analysis confirms high expression of 
SNHG1 as an independent prognostic marker for event-free survival (EFS) (HR =
1.58, P = 2.36E-02). In conclusion, our study unveils that SNHG1 is up-regulated 
by MYCN amplification and could be a potential prognostic biomarker for high-risk
NB intervention.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the main cause of cancer mortality worldwide.
Its poor prognosis is mainly ascribed to high recurrence rate. Identifying novel 
prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets would be vital for HCC management. 
Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is a class of RNA with various roles in
tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance
and functions of lncRNA-small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1) in HCC. In this
study, we found SNHG1 was upregulated in HCC tissues in comparison with adjacent 
liver tissues in both publicly available microarray data and our own cohort. High
SNHG1 expression was correlated with large tumor size, poor differentiation, and 
aggressive BCLC stage. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that high
SNHG1 expression predicts poor prognosis of HCC patients. Gain-of-function and
loss-of function experiments showed that SNHG1 promotes HCC cells proliferation, 
cell cycle progression, and inhibits HCC cells apoptosis. Further experiments
revealed that SNHG1 promotes HCC cells proliferation through inhibiting p53 and
p53-target genes expression. Collectively, our results demonstrated the clinical 
prognostic significance and roles of SNHG1 in HCC, and suggested that SNHG1 may
be considered as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressing neurodegenerative disorder that 
affects approximately seven million patients worldwide. Despite intensive
research, the molecular mechanisms initiating and promoting PD are still unknown.
However, it is assumed that environmental factors trigger PD. Recent research
demonstrated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) interfere in transcriptional and
translational processes modulating gene expression reflecting environmental
influences. Nevertheless, there is no systematic analysis available that
investigates the impact of lncRNAs on PD. In the current study, we performed a
comprehensive analysis on expression levels of 90 well-annotated lncRNAs in 30
brain specimens deriving from 20 PD patients and 10 controls as a preliminary
report on the significance of lncRNAs in PD. Expression profiling of lncRNAs
revealed that five lncRNAs are significantly differentially expressed in PD.
While H19 upstream conserved 1 and 2 is significantly downregulated in PD,
lincRNA-p21, Malat1, SNHG1, and TncRNA are significantly upregulated. An analysis
on expression levels and PD stages revealed that the identified dysregulated
lncRNA are altered already in early disease stage and that they precede the
course of PD. In summary, this is the first comprehensive analysis on lncRNAs in 
PD revealing significantly altered lncRNAs. Additionally, we found that lncRNA
dysregulations precede the course of the disease. Thus, the five newly identified
lncRNAs may serve as potential new biomarkers appropriate even in early PD. They 
may be used in monitoring disease progression and they may serve as potential new
targets for novel therapeutic approaches.

p53 is a master tumour repressor that participates in vast regulatory networks,
including feedback loops involving microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate p53 and that 
themselves are direct p53 transcriptional targets. We show here that a group of
polycistronic miRNA-like non-coding RNAs derived from small nucleolar RNAs
(sno-miRNAs) are transcriptionally repressed by p53 through their host gene,
SNHG1. The most abundant of these, sno-miR-28, directly targets the
p53-stabilizing gene, TAF9B. Collectively, p53, SNHG1, sno-miR-28 and TAF9B form 
a regulatory loop which affects p53 stability and downstream p53-regulated
pathways. In addition, SNHG1, SNORD28 and sno-miR-28 are all significantly
upregulated in breast tumours and the overexpression of sno-miR-28 promotes
breast epithelial cell proliferation. This research has broadened our knowledge
of the crosstalk between small non-coding RNA pathways and roles of sno-miRNAs in
p53 regulation.

BACKGROUND: Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major cause of cancer death 
worldwide. Increasing evidence shows that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are widely
involved in the development and progression of NSCLC. ncRNA small nucleolar RNA
host gene 1 (SNHG1) has not been studied in cancer, especially its role in lung
cancer remains unknown. Our studies were designed to investigate the expression
and biological significance of SNHG1 in lung cancer. SNHG1 may be a novel ncRNA
in early diagnosis in lung cancer.
METHODS: Noncoding RNA SNHG1 expression in 7 lung cancer cell lines was measured 
by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RNA interference approaches 
were used to find the biological functions of SNHG1. The effect of SNHG1 on
proliferation was evaluated by cell count and crystal violet stains.
RESULTS: Noncoding RNA SNHG1 expression was significantly upregulated in lung
cancer cells when compared with normal bronchial epithelial cells. In addition,
in vitro assays our results indicated that knockdown of SNHG1 inhibited cell
proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that ncRNA SNHG1 is significantly upregulated in 
NSCLC cell lines and may represent a new biomarker and a potential therapeutic
target for NSCLC intervention.

A wide variety of biological effects are induced in cells that are exposed to
ionizing radiation. The expression changes of coding mRNA and non-coding
micro-RNA have been implicated in irradiated cells. The involvement of other
classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), such as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), long 
ncRNAs (lncRNAs), and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in cells recovering from
radiation-induced damage has not been examined. Thus, we investigated whether
these ncRNA were undergoing changes in cells exposed to ionizing radiation. The
modulation of ncRNAs expression was determined in human TK6 (p53 positive) and
WTK1 (p53 negative) cells. The snoRNA host genes SNHG1, SNHG6, and SNHG11 were
induced in TK6 cells. In WTK1 cells, SNHG1 was induced but SNHG6, and SNHG11 were
repressed. SNHG7 was repressed in TK6 cells and was upregulated in WTK1 cells.
The lncRNA MALAT1 and SOX2OT were induced in both TK6 and WTK1 cells and SRA1 was
induced in TK6 cells only. Interestingly, the MIAT and PIWIL1 were not expressed 
in TK6 cells before or after the ionizing radiation treatment. The MIAT and
PIWIL1 were upregulated in WTK1 cells. This data provides evidence that altered
ncRNA expression is a part of the complex stress response operating in
radiation-treated cells and this response depends on functional p53.

PURPOSE: The enhanced S-cone syndrome (ESCS) is a rare hereditary retinal
degeneration that has enhanced short wavelength-sensitive cone (S-cone)
functions. The longitudinal clinical course of this disease has been rarely
reported, and the genetic aspects of ESCS have not been well investigated in the 
Japanese population. In this report, we present our clinical and genetic findings
for 2 patients with ESCS.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients were 2 unrelated Japanese men. Standard
ophthalmic examinations and mutation screening for the NR2E3 gene were performed.
RESULTS: Patient 1 was a 36-year-old man, and his clinical findings were typical 
of ESCS. His decimal best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.0 OD and 0.5 OS
after removal of cataracts. Genetic investigations revealed a homozygous
truncation frameshift, the p.I307LfsX33 mutation. Patient 2 was an 11-year-old
boy when he was first examined by us. His clinical findings were typical of ESCS 
except for uveitis in the left eye. His decimal BCVA at the age of 39 years was
maintained at 1.5 in each eye, although the retinal degeneration and visual field
impairments had progressed during the follow-up period. The genetic
investigations revealed homozygous mutations of p.R104Q in the NR2E3 gene.
CONCLUSIONS: The frameshift mutation, p.I307LfsX33, in the NR2E3 gene is a new
causative mutation for ESCS. The clinical observations for patient 2 are the
longest ever reported. The retinal degeneration caused by this mutation is slowly
progressive, and these patients maintained good vision with maintenance of the
foveal structure until their late thirties.

Unlike in mammals, persistent postembryonic retinal growth is a characteristic
feature of fish, which includes major remodeling events that affect all cell
types including photoreceptors. Consequently, visual capabilities change during
development, where retinal sensitivity to different wavelengths of light
(photopic vision), -and to limited photons (scotopic vision) are central
capabilities for survival. Differently from well-established model fish, Atlantic
cod has a prolonged larval stage where only cone photoreceptors are present. Rods
do not appear until juvenile transition (metamorphosis), a hallmark of indirect
developing species. Previously we showed that whole gene families of lws
(red-sensitive) and sws1 (UV-sensitive) opsins have been lost in cod, while rh2a 
(green-sensitive) and sws2 (blue-sensitive) genes have tandem duplicated. Here,
we provide a comprehensive characterization of a two-step developing duplex
retina in Atlantic cod. The study focuses on cone subtype dynamics and delayed
rod neurogenesis and differentiation in all cod life stages. Using transcriptomic
and histological approaches we show that different opsins disappear in a
topographic manner during development where central to peripheral retina is a key
axis of expressional change. Early cone differentiation was initiated in
dorso-temporal retina different from previously described in fish. Rods first
appeared during initiation of metamorphosis and expression of the nuclear
receptor transcription factor nr2e3-1, suggest involvement in rod specification. 
The indirect developmental strategy thus allows for separate studies of cones and
rods development, which in nature correlates with visual changes linked to
habitat shifts. The clustering of key retinal genes according to life stage,
suggests that Atlantic cod with its sequenced genome may be an important resource
for identification of underlying factors required for development and function of
photopic and scotopic vision.

Ex vivo electroporation of mouse retinas is an established tool to modulate gene 
expression and to study cell type-specific gene expression. Here we coupled
ex vivo electroporation to luciferase reporter assays to facilitate the study of 
rod-photoreceptor-specific gene promoters. The activity of the rod-specific
proximal bovine rhodopsin promoter was significantly increased in C57BL/6J
wild-type retinas at postnatal days 1 and 7 by 3.4-fold and 8.7-fold
respectively. In C57BL/6J Nr2e3(rd7/rd7) retinas, where the rod
photoreceptor-specific nuclear receptor Nr2e3 is not expressed, a significant
increase by 2.5-fold was only observed at postnatal day 7. Cone-specific S-opsin 
promoter activity was not modulated in C57BL/6J wild-type and Nr2e3(rd7/rd7)
retinas. Taken together, we describe an easily implementable protocol to assess
rod-specific promoter activity in a physiological context resembling that of the 
developing postnatal mouse retina.

As noted by Darwin, chickens have the greatest phenotypic diversity of all birds,
but an interesting evolutionary difference between domestic chickens and their
wild ancestor, the Red Junglefowl, is their comparatively weaker vision. Existing
theories suggest that diminished visual prowess among domestic chickens reflect
changes driven by the relaxation of functional constraints on vision, but the
evidence identifying the underlying genetic mechanisms responsible for this
change has not been definitively characterized. Here, a genome-wide analysis of
the domestic chicken and Red Junglefowl genomes showed significant enrichment for
positively selected genes involved in the development of vision. There were
significant differences between domestic chickens and their wild ancestors
regarding the level of mRNA expression for these genes in the retina. Numerous
additional genes involved in the development of vision also showed significant
differences in mRNA expression between domestic chickens and their wild
ancestors, particularly for genes associated with phototransduction and
photoreceptor development, such as RHO (rhodopsin), GUCA1A, PDE6B and NR2E3.
Finally, we characterized the potential role of the VIT gene in vision, which
experienced positive selection and downregulated expression in the retina of the 
village chicken. Overall, our results suggest that positive selection, rather
than relaxation of purifying selection, contributed to the evolution of vision in
domestic chickens. The progenitors of domestic chickens harboring weaker vision
may have showed a reduced fear response and vigilance, making them easier to be
unconsciously selected and/or domesticated.

Rod and cone photoreceptors are highly similar in many respects but they have
important functional and molecular differences. Here, we investigate genome-wide 
patterns of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility in mouse rods and cones
and correlate differences in these features with gene expression, histone marks, 
transcription factor binding, and DNA sequence motifs. Loss of NR2E3 in rods
shifts their epigenomes to a more cone-like state. The data further reveal wide
differences in DNA methylation between retinal photoreceptors and brain neurons. 
Surprisingly, we also find a substantial fraction of DNA hypo-methylated regions 
in adult rods that are not in active chromatin. Many of these regions exhibit
hallmarks of regulatory regions that were active earlier in neuronal development,
suggesting that these regions could remain undermethylated due to the highly
compact chromatin in mature rods. This work defines the epigenomic landscapes of 
rods and cones, revealing features relevant to photoreceptor development and
function.

IMPORTANCE: This research is the single largest NR2E3 genotype-phenotype
correlation study performed to date in autosomal dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyse the frequency of the p.Gly56Arg
mutation in NR2E3 for the largest cohort of autosomal dominant Retinitis
Pigmentosa patients to date and its associated phenotype.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 201 unrelated Spanish families affected by
autosomal dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa. The p.Gly56Arg mutation in the NR2E3
(NM_014249.2) gene was analysed in 201 families. In the 24 cases where the
mutation had been detected, a haplotype analysis linked to the p.Gly56Arg
families was performed, using four extragenic polymorphic markers D15S967,
D15S1050, D15S204 and D15S188. Phenotype study included presence and age of onset
of night blindness, visual field loss and cataracts; and an ophthalmoscopic
examination after pupillary dilation and electroretinogram for the 24 cases.
RESULTS: Seven of the 201 analyzed families were positive for the p.Gly56Arg,
leading to a prevalence of 3.5%. Clinical data were available for 24 subjects.
Night blindness was the first noticeable symptom (mean 15.9 years). Visual field 
loss onset was variable (23.3 ± 11.9 years). Loss of visual acuity appeared late 
in the disease´s evolution. Most of the patients with cataracts (50%) presented
it from the third decade of life. Fundus changes showed inter and intrafamiliar
variability, but most of the patients showed typical RP changes and it was common
to find macular affectation (47.4%). Electroretinogram was impaired from the
beginning of the disease. Two families shared a common haplotype. Additionally,
all patients shared a 104Kb region between D15S1050 and the NR2E3 gene.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of p.Gly56Arg in the NR2E3 gene
as a common mutation associated with adRP, and provides new clues to its
phenotype, which can allow for a better clinical management and genetic
counselling of patients and their families.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical phenotype of ten Tunisian families with
non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP), to characterize genes and mutations
causing these conditions, and to elaborate phenotype-genotype correlations.
METHODS: Descriptive clinical genetic study of 114 individuals, of whom 27 are
affected by non-syndromic RP. Ophthalmic examination and various visual tests
were performed. DNA was analyzed using single nucleotide polymorphism,
microsatellite genotyping and direct sequencing to determine the genes and
mutations involved.
RESULTS: We identified seven mutated genes: RPE65, RDH12, USHER 2A, PDE6a, PDE6b,
CRB1, and NR2E3. Analysis of phenotype-genotype correlation indicated that some
genes were associated with specific phenotypes. In RPE65 mutations, we found
early onset dystrophy, nystagmus, keratoconus, white dot deposits in earlier
stages and clumped pigment in later stages. The RDH12-associated phenotype
(juvenile RP) showed severe and early-onset dystrophy, diffuse spicule
pigmentation, macular edema and thickening, and tomographic re-organization of
retinal layers. The CRB1 mutation was characterized by preserved para-arteriolar 
retinal pigment epithelium and no hemeralopia.
CONCLUSION: RP is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. The two ultimate
goals of research are to provide efficient clinical diagnostic of affected gene
by phenotype-genotype correlation and to design novel treatment regimens. Our
goal is to create a specific chip for our population, and then future research
will focus on the identification of the remaining causal genes, the elucidation
of the molecular mechanisms of disease in the retina and the development of gene

PURPOSE: The neurohormones melatonin and dopamine mediate
clock-dependent/circadian regulation of inner retinal neurons and photoreceptor
cells and in this way promote their functional adaptation to time of day and
their survival. To fulfill this function they act on melatonin receptor type 1
(MT1 receptors) and dopamine D4 receptors (D4 receptors), respectively. The aim
of the present study was to screen transcriptional regulators important for
retinal physiology and/or pathology (Dbp, Egr-1, Fos, Nr1d1, Nr2e3, Nr4a1,
Pgc-1α, Rorβ) for circadian regulation and dependence on melatonin signaling/MT1 
receptors or dopamine signaling/D4 receptors.
METHODS: This was done by gene profiling using quantitative polymerase chain
reaction in mice deficient in MT1 or D4 receptors.
RESULTS: The data obtained determined Pgc-1α and Nr4a1 as transcriptional targets
of circadian melatonin and dopamine signaling, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that Pgc-1α and Nr4a1 represent candidate genes 
for linking circadian neurohormone release with functional adaptation and
healthiness of retina and photoreceptor cells.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to test a newly devised cost-effective multiplex PCR
assay for the molecular diagnosis of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa
(adRP), as well as the use of whole-exome sequencing (WES) to detect
disease-causing mutations in adRP.
METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes of index
patients with adRP and their affected and unaffected family members. We used a
newly devised multiplex PCR assay capable of amplifying the genetic loci of RHO, 
PRPH2, RP1, PRPF3, PRPF8, PRPF31, IMPDH1, NRL, CRX, KLHL7, and NR2E3 to
molecularly diagnose 18 index patients with adRP. We also performed WES in
affected and unaffected members of four families with adRP in whom a
disease-causing mutation was previously not found.
RESULTS: We identified five previously reported mutations (p.Arg677X in the RP1
gene, p.Asp133Val and p.Arg195Leu in the PRPH2 gene, and p.Pro171Leu and
p.Pro215Leu in the RHO gene) and one novel mutation (p.Val345Gly in the RHO gene)
representing 33% detection of causative mutations in our adRP cohort. Comparative
WES analysis showed a new variant (p.Gly103Arg in the COL6A6 gene) that
segregated with the disease in one family with adRP. As this variant was linked
with the RHO locus, we sequenced the complete RHO gene, which revealed a deletion
in intron 4 that encompassed all of exon 5 and 28 bp of the 3'-untranslated
region (UTR).
CONCLUSIONS: The novel multiplex PCR assay with next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
proved effective for detecting most of the adRP-causing mutations. A WES approach
led to identification of a deletion in RHO through detection of a new linked
variant in COL6A6. No pathogenic variants were identified in the remaining three 
families. Moreover, NGS and WES were inefficient for detecting the complete
deletion of exon 5 in the RHO gene in one family with adRP. Carriers of this
deletion showed variable clinical status, and two of these carriers had not
previously been diagnosed with RP.

The derivation of three-dimensional (3D) stratified neural retina from
pluripotent stem cells has permitted investigations of human photoreceptors. We
have generated a H9 human embryonic stem cell subclone that carries a green
fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter under the control of the promoter of cone-rod 
homeobox (CRX), an established marker of postmitotic photoreceptor precursors.
The CRXp-GFP reporter replicates endogenous CRX expression in vitro when the H9
subclone is induced to form self-organizing 3D retina-like tissue. At day 37,
CRX+ photoreceptors appear in the basal or middle part of neural retina and
migrate to apical side by day 67. Temporal and spatial patterns of retinal cell
type markers recapitulate the predicted sequence of development. Cone gene
expression is concomitant with CRX, whereas rod differentiation factor neural
retina leucine zipper protein (NRL) is first observed at day 67. At day 90,
robust expression of NRL and its target nuclear receptor NR2E3 is evident in many
CRX+ cells, while minimal S-opsin and no rhodopsin or L/M-opsin is present. The
transcriptome profile, by RNA-seq, of developing human photoreceptors is
remarkably concordant with mRNA and immunohistochemistry data available for human
fetal retina although many targets of CRX, including phototransduction genes,
exhibit a significant delay in expression. We report on temporal changes in gene 
signatures, including expression of cell surface markers and transcription
factors; these expression changes should assist in isolation of photoreceptors at
distinct stages of differentiation and in delineating coexpression networks. Our 
studies establish the first global expression database of developing human
photoreceptors, providing a reference map for functional studies in retinal
cultures.

Inorganic arsenic is a human lung carcinogen. We studied the ability of chronic
inorganic arsenic (2 μM; as sodium arsenite) exposure to induce a cancer
phenotype in the immortalized, non-tumorigenic human lung peripheral epithelial
cell line, HPL-1D. After 38 weeks of continuous arsenic exposure, secreted matrix
metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) activity increased to over 200% of control, levels
linked to arsenic-induced cancer phenotypes in other cell lines. The invasive
capacity of these chronic arsenic-treated lung epithelial (CATLE) cells increased
to 320% of control and colony formation increased to 280% of control. CATLE cells
showed enhanced proliferation in serum-free media indicative of autonomous
growth. Compared to control cells, CATLE cells showed reduced protein expression 
of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN (decreased to 26% of control) and the putative 
tumor suppressor gene SLC38A3 (14% of control). Morphological evidence of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurred in CATLE cells together with 
appropriate changes in expression of the EMT markers vimentin (VIM; increased to 
300% of control) and e-cadherin (CDH1; decreased to 16% of control). EMT is
common in carcinogenic transformation of epithelial cells. CATLE cells showed
increased KRAS (291%), ERK1/2 (274%), phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK; 152%), and
phosphorylated AKT1 (p-AKT1; 170%) protein expression. Increased transcript
expression of metallothioneins, MT1A and MT2A and the stress response genes HMOX1
(690%) and HIF1A (247%) occurred in CATLE cells possibly in adaptation to chronic
arsenic exposure. Thus, arsenic induced multiple cancer cell characteristics in
human peripheral lung epithelial cells. This model may be useful to assess
mechanisms of arsenic-induced lung cancer.

Expression of glutamine transporter Slc38a3 (SNAT3) during acidosis is mediated
by a different mechanism than tissue-specific expression.

BACKGROUND: Despite homeostatic pH regulation, systemic and cellular pH changes
take place and strongly influence metabolic processes. Transcription of the
glutamine transporter SNAT3 (Slc38a3) for instance is highly up-regulated in the 
kidney during metabolic acidosis to provide glutamine for ammonia production.
METHODS: Slc38a3 promoter activity and messenger RNA stability were measured in
cultured cells in response to different extracellular pH values.
RESULTS: Up-regulation of SNAT3 mRNA was mediated both by the stabilization of
its mRNA and by the up-regulation of gene transcription. Stabilisation of the
mRNA involved a pH-response element, while enhanced transcription made use of a
second pH-sensitive Sp1 binding site in addition to a constitutive Sp1 binding
site. Transcriptional regulation dominated the early response to acidosis, while 
mRNA stability was more important for chronic adaptation. Tissue-specific
expression of SNAT3, by contrast, appeared to be controlled by promoter
methylation and histone modifications.
CONCLUSIONS: Regulation of SNAT3 gene expression by extracellular pH involves
post-transcriptional and transcriptional mechanisms, the latter being distinct
from the mechanisms that control the tissue-specific expression of the gene.

Calpain cleavage and inactivation of the sodium calcium exchanger-3 occur
downstream of Aβ in Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
pathological deposits of β-amyloid (Aβ) in senile plaques, intracellular
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) comprising hyperphosphorylated aggregated tau,
synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Substantial evidence indicates that
disrupted neuronal calcium homeostasis is an early event in AD that could mediate
synaptic dysfunction and neuronal toxicity. Sodium calcium exchangers (NCXs) play
important roles in regulating intracellular calcium, and accumulating data
suggests that reduced NCX function, following aberrant proteolytic cleavage of
these exchangers, may contribute to neurodegeneration. Here, we show that
elevated calpain, but not caspase-3, activity is a prominent feature of AD brain.
In addition, we observe increased calpain-mediated cleavage of NCX3, but not a
related family member NCX1, in AD brain relative to unaffected tissue and that
from other neurodegenerative conditions. Moreover, the extent of NCX3 proteolysis
correlated significantly with amounts of Aβ1-42. We also show that exposure of
primary cortical neurons to oligomeric Aβ1-42 results in calpain-dependent
cleavage of NCX3, and we demonstrate that loss of NCX3 function is associated
with Aβ toxicity. Our findings suggest that Aβ mediates calpain cleavage of NCX3 
in AD brain and therefore that reduced NCX3 activity could contribute to the
sustained increases in intraneuronal calcium concentrations that are associated
with synaptic and neuronal dysfunction in AD.

Human macrophages and monocytes express functional Na(+)/Ca (2+) exchangers 1 and
3.

The Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) is a plasma membrane protein that can switch
Na(+) and Ca(2+) in either direction to maintain the homeostasis of intracellular
Ca(2+). A family of three genes (NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3) has been identified in
neurons and muscle cells. NCX activity has also been reported in certain immune
cells (e.g., mast cells). We have examined the expression and function of these
NCX isoforms in the human monocytes and lung macrophages. Monocytes were purified
from peripheral blood of healthy donors. Macrophages (HLM) were isolated and
purified from the lung parenchyma of patients undergoing thoracic surgery. NCX1
and NCX3, but not NCX2, were expressed in HLM and monocytes at both mRNA and
protein level. Exposure to Na(+)-free medium induced a significant increase in
intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in both cell types, suggesting 
that NCX isoforms expressed on these cells were functionally active. This
response was completely abolished by the NCX inhibitor
5-(N-4-chlorobenzyl)-20,40-dimethylbenzamil (CB-DMB). In addition, incubation of 
macrophages with Na(+)-free medium induced a marked release of TNF-α.
Preincubation of HLM with CB-DMB and RNAi-mediated knockdown of NCX1 blocked
TNF-α release. Our results demonstrate that human macrophages and monocytes
express NCX1 and NCX3 that operate in a bidirectional manner to restore
[Ca(2+)](i) to generate Ca(2+) signals and to induce TNF-α production. We suggest
that NCX may modulate Ca(2+) homeostasis and proinflammatory functions in human
macrophages and monocytes.

Immunosuppressive drugs, immunophilins, and functional expression of NCX
isoforms.

Although the three mammalian Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchangers share considerable amino
acid sequence homology, they exhibit substantial immunosuppressive drug
specificity. We have shown that cyclosporin A (CsA) treatment of NCX1-, NCX2-, or
NCX3-transfected HEK 293 cells and non-transfected H9c2, L6, and aortic smooth
muscle cells, which express NCX1 protein naturally, reduces NCX surface
expression and transport activity but has no impact on total cell NCX protein.
Similar effect on functional expression of NCX1 protein can be obtained also
without CsA treatment by knockdown of cell cyclophilin A (CypA), one of the
cellular receptor of CsA. This suggests that CypA has a role in acquisition of
function competence of NCX1 protein.Unlike CsA treatment, which affects the
functional expression of all three mammalian NCX proteins similarly, FK506 and
rapamycin treatment modulates only the functional expression of NCX2 and NCX3
proteins. FK506 reduces NCX2 and NCX3 surface expression and transport activity
without affecting cell NCX protein. Rapamycin reduces NCX2 and NCX3 transport
activity but has no effect on their surface expression or total cell NCX protein 
expression suggesting that, although it shares a common receptor FKBP with FK506,
its mode of action follows a different pathway.We are showing now that the large 
cytosolic loop of NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3 is involved in acquisition of
immunosuppressive drug specificity: truncation of the large cytosolic loop of
NCX1 renders the protein sensitive to FK506. Exchange of the large cytosolic loop
of NCX3 with that of NCX1 renders the mutant protein insensitive to FK506.

Zinc depletion causes multiple defects in ovarian function during the
periovulatory period in mice.

Tian X(1), Diaz FJ.

Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA.

Shortly before ovulation, the oocyte acquires developmental competence and
granulosa cells undergo tremendous changes including cumulus expansion and
luteinization. Zinc is emerging as a key regulator of meiosis in vitro, but a
complete understanding of zinc-mediated effects during the periovulatory period
is lacking. The present study uncovers the previously unknown role of zinc in
maintaining meiotic arrest before ovulation. A zinc chelator [N,N,N',N'-tetrakis 
(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN)] caused premature germinal vesicle
breakdown and associated spindle defects in denuded oocytes even in the presence 
of a phosphodiesterase 3A inhibitor (milrinone). TPEN also potently blocked
cumulus expansion by blocking induction of expansion-related transcripts Has2,
Ptx3, Ptgs2, and Tnfaip6 mRNA. Both meiotic arrest and cumulus expansion were
rescued by exogenous zinc. Lack of cumulus expansion is due to an almost complete
suppression of phospho-Sma- and Mad-related protein 2/3 signaling. Consistent
with a decrease in phospho-Sma- and Mad-related protein 2/3 signaling, TPEN also 
decreased cumulus transcripts (Ar and Slc38a3) and caused a surprising increase
in mural transcripts (Lhcgr and Cyp11a1) in cumulus cells. In vivo, feeding a
zinc-deficient diet for 10 d completely blocked ovulation and compromised cumulus
expansion. However, 42.5% of oocytes had prematurely resumed meiosis before human
chorionic gonadotropin injection, underscoring the importance of zinc before
ovulation. A more acute 3-d treatment with a zinc-deficient diet did not block
ovulation but did increase the number of oocytes trapped in luteinizing
follicles. Moreover, 23% of ovulated oocytes did not reach metaphase II due to
severe spindle defects. Thus, acute zinc deficiency causes profound defects
during the periovulatory period with consequences for oocyte maturation, cumulus 
expansion, and ovulation.

Changes in intracellular [Ca(2+)](i) levels have been shown to influence
developmental processes that accompany the transition of human oligodendrocyte
precursor cells (OPCs) into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes and are required 
for the initiation of the myelination and re-myelination processes. In the
present study, we explored whether calcium signals mediated by the selective
sodium calcium exchanger (NCX) family members NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3, play a role
in oligodendrocyte maturation. Functional studies, as well as mRNA and protein
expression analyses, revealed that NCX1 and NCX3, but not NCX2, were divergently 
modulated during OPC differentiation into oligodendrocyte phenotype. In fact,
whereas NCX1 was downregulated, NCX3 was strongly upregulated during
oligodendrocyte development. The importance of calcium signaling mediated by NCX3
during oligodendrocyte maturation was supported by several findings. Indeed,
whereas knocking down the NCX3 isoform in OPCs prevented the upregulation of the 
myelin protein markers 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide-3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) and 
myelin basic protein (MBP), its overexpression induced an upregulation of CNPase 
and MBP. Furthermore, NCX3-knockout mice showed not only a reduced size of spinal
cord but also marked hypo-myelination, as revealed by decrease in MBP expression 
and by an accompanying increase in OPC number. Collectively, our findings
indicate that calcium signaling mediated by NCX3 has a crucial role in
oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin formation.

Identification of SLC38A7 (SNAT7) protein as a glutamine transporter expressed in
neurons.

The SLC38 family of transporters has in total 11 members in humans and they
encode amino acid transporters called sodium-coupled amino acid transporters
(SNAT). To date, five SNATs have been characterized and functionally subdivided
into systems A (SLC38A1, SLC38A2, and SLC38A4) and N (SLC38A3 and SLC38A5)
showing the highest transport for glutamine and alanine. Here we present
identification of a novel glutamine transporter encoded by the Slc38a7 gene,
which we propose should be named SNAT7. This transporter has L-glutamine as the
preferred substrate but also transports other amino acids with polar side chains,
as well as L-histidine and L-alanine. The expression pattern and substrate
profile for SLC38A7 shows highest similarity to the known system N transporters. 
Therefore, we propose that SLC38A7 is a novel member of this system. We used in
situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry with a custom-made antibody to show
that SLC38A7 is expressed in all neurons, but not in astrocytes, in the mouse
brain. SLC38A7 is unique in being the first system N transporter expressed in
GABAergic and also other neurons. The preferred substrate and axonal localization
of SLC38A7 close to the synaptic cleft indicates that SLC38A7 could have an
important function for the reuptake and recycling of glutamate.

Intracellular free Ca2+ (Ca(i)2+) is an important regulator of many cellular
activities; however, Ca2+ signaling is not well studied in human preadipocytes.
The purpose of the present study was to characterize Ca2+ signal pathways using a
confocal scanning technique and RT-PCR. It was found that spontaneous Ca(i)2+
oscillations were observed in 12.1% preadipocytes, and number of cells with Ca2+ 
oscillations was increased to 47.9% by 1% fetal bovine serum. Ca(i)2+
oscillations were dependent on Ca2+ entry mainly via stored-operated Ca2+ (SOC)
entry. They were suppressed by the SOC entry channel blocker La3+, the
phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122, the inositol trisphosphate receptor
(IP3R) blocker 2-amino-ethoxydiphenyl borate, or the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic
reticulum Ca2+ pump (SERCA) inhibitors thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid, but
not by ryanodine. The IP3R activator thimerosal increased Ca(i)2+ oscillations.
In addition, the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (PMCA) inhibitor carboxyeosin and
Na+--Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) inhibitor Ni2+ both suppressed Ca2+ oscillations.
RT-PCR revealed that the mRNAs for IP3R1-3, SERCA1,2, NCX3 and PMCA1,3,4,
Ca(V)1.2, and TRPC1,4,6, STIM1 and Orai1 (for SOC entry channels) were
significant in human preadipocytes. The present study demonstrates that multiple 
Ca2+ signal pathways are present in human preadipocytes, and provides a basis for
investigating how Ca2+ signals regulate biological and physiological activities
of human preadipocytes.

Mammalian Na+/Ca2+ exchangers are members of three branches of a much larger
family of transport proteins [the CaCA (Ca2+/cation antiporter) superfamily]
whose main role is to provide control of Ca2+ flux across the plasma membranes or
intracellular compartments. Since cytosolic levels of Ca2+ are much lower than
those found extracellularly or in sequestered stores, the major function of
Na+/Ca2+ exchangers is to extrude Ca2+ from the cytoplasm. The exchangers are,
however, fully reversible and thus, under special conditions of subcellular
localization and compartmentalized ion gradients, Na+/Ca2+ exchangers may allow
Ca2+ entry and may play more specialized roles in Ca2+ movement between
compartments. The NCX (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger) [SLC (solute carrier) 8] branch of
Na+/Ca2+ exchangers comprises three members: NCX1 has been most extensively
studied, and is broadly expressed with particular abundance in heart, brain and
kidney, NCX2 is expressed in brain, and NCX3 is expressed in brain and skeletal
muscle. The NCX proteins subserve a variety of roles, depending upon the site of 
expression. These include cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, neuronal
signalling and Ca2+ reabsorption in the kidney. The NCKX (Na2+/Ca2+-K+ exchanger)
(SLC24) branch of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers transport K+ and Ca2+ in exchange for Na+, 
and comprises five members: NCKX1 is expressed in retinal rod photoreceptors,
NCKX2 is expressed in cone photoreceptors and in neurons throughout the brain,
NCKX3 and NCKX4 are abundant in brain, but have a broader tissue distribution,
and NCKX5 is expressed in skin, retinal epithelium and brain. The NCKX proteins
probably play a particularly prominent role in regulating Ca2+ flux in
environments which experience wide and frequent fluctuations in Na+
concentration. Until recently, the range of functions that NCKX proteins play was
generally underappreciated. This situation is now changing rapidly as evidence
emerges for roles including photoreceptor adaptation, synaptic plasticity and
skin pigmentation. The CCX (Ca2+/cation exchanger) branch has only one mammalian 
member, NCKX6 or NCLX (Na+/Ca2+-Li+ exchanger), whose physiological function
remains unclear, despite a broad pattern of expression.

Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is commonly used for controlling opioid
dependence, preventing withdrawal symptoms, and improving the quality of life of 
heroin-dependent patients. A steady-state plasma concentration of methadone
enantiomers, a measure of methadone metabolism, is an index of treatment response
and efficacy of MMT. Although the methadone metabolism pathway has been partially
revealed, no genome-wide pharmacogenomic study has been performed to identify
genetic determinants and characterize genetic mechanisms for the plasma
concentrations of methadone R- and S-enantiomers. This study was the first
genome-wide pharmacogenomic study to identify genes associated with the plasma
concentrations of methadone R- and S-enantiomers and their respective metabolites
in a methadone maintenance cohort. After data quality control was ensured, a
dataset of 344 heroin-dependent patients in the Han Chinese population of Taiwan 
who underwent MMT was analyzed. Genome-wide single-locus and haplotype-based
association tests were performed to analyze four quantitative traits: the plasma 
concentrations of methadone R- and S-enantiomers and their respective
metabolites. A significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs17180299 (raw 
p = 2.24 × 10(-8)), was identified, accounting for 9.541% of the variation in the
plasma concentration of the methadone R-enantiomer. In addition, 17 haplotypes
were identified on SPON1, GSG1L, and CYP450 genes associated with the plasma
concentration of methadone S-enantiomer. These haplotypes accounted for
approximately one-fourth of the variation of the overall S-methadone plasma
concentration. The association between the S-methadone plasma concentration and
CYP2B6, SPON1, and GSG1L were replicated in another independent study. A gene
expression experiment revealed that CYP2B6, SPON1, and GSG1L can be activated
concomitantly through a constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) activation
pathway. In conclusion, this study revealed new genes associated with the plasma 
concentration of methadone, providing insight into the genetic foundation of
methadone metabolism. The results can be applied to predict treatment responses
and methadone-related deaths for individualized MMTs.

F-spondin was originally isolated from the developing embryonic floor plate of
vertebrates, secreting numerous kinds of neuron-related molecules. The protein
performs a positive function in nervous system development, which is attributed
to the high conservation of F-spondin protein, an extracellular matrix (ECM)
protein in several species. However, its precise function remains unknown,
especially in marine fish. In this study, the F-spondin of Japanese flounder
(Paralichthys olivaceus). was cloned, and its expression pattern and structural
characteristics were analyzed. The 2421bp-long cDNA ORF of PoF-spondin was
obtained and divided into 14 exons spread over 61,496bp of the genomic sequence. 
Phylogenetic analysis showed that PoF-spondin was actually the ortholog of the
human spon1 gene and shared high identities with other teleost spon1a genes.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that PoF-spondin was maternally expressed,
and transcripts were present from one-cell stage to hatching stage, peaking at
tailbud stage. Tissue distribution analysis indicated that PoF-spondin was
detectable mainly in the gonads (especially in the ovary) and the brain. Whole
mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the PoF-spondin transcription 
distributed throughout the cleavage of the ball in the early stage and expressed 
at a high level in the floor plate of the trunk at tailbud and pre-hatching
stages. Furthermore, the expression of genes related to nervous system
development (spon1b, foxo3b, and foxj1a) was significantly increased after the
injection of PoF-spondin into the embryos of wild-type zebrafish. Furthermore,
PoF-spondin significantly suppressed the expression of the chordamesoderm marker 
gene ntl, increased the expression of otx2/krox20, ectoderm mark genes, and left 
the expression of dorsal mesodermal marker gene gsc unaffected at 50% epiboly
stage in zebrafish. In short, our results suggest that PoF-spondin functions in
the development of the teleost nervous system.

Spondin 1 (SPON1) is cell adhesion protein that involved in attachment of sensory
neuron cells and outgrowth of neurites. Its cellular functions and related
mechanisms in cancers, however, remain largely unexplored. In this study, we
first identified that SPON1 acts a critical factor in the metastatic progression 
of osteosarcoma through analysis of a GEO dataset. Then we demonstrated that
SPON1 was significantly up-regulated in 72 osteosarcoma specimens compared with
benign osteochondroma samples and elevated SPON1 was positively correlated with
MMP9 expression. Knockdown of SPON1 expression in two metastatic osteosarcoma
cell lines, HKOS and KRIB, dramatically suppressed cell migration and invasion.
Treatment with recombinant SPON1 protein in two non-metastatic osteosarcoma cell 
lines, HOS and U2OS, significantly promoted cell migration and invasion in vitro.
Meanwhile, suppression of SPON1 in KHOS cells resulted in decreased pulmonary
metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, we determined that the effects of SPON1 on
osteosarcoma cell motility were primarily mediated through Fak and Src dependent 
pathway. Taken together, our study provides evidence of the contributions of
SPON1 and the Fak and Src signaling to the progression of osteosarcoma and
suggests that this axis may represent a potential therapeutic target for
osteosarcoma.

INTRODUCTION: Stimulation of mesenchymal stromal cells and adipose tissue-derived
stromal cells (ASCs) with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been used
in multiple animal studies and clinical trials for regenerative purposes. VEGF
stimulation is believed to promote angiogenesis and VEGF stimulation is usually
performed under serum deprivation. Potential regenerative molecular mechanisms
are numerous and the role of contributing factors is uncertain. The aim of the
current study was to investigate the effect of in vitro serum deprivation and
VEGF stimulation on gene expression patterns of ASCs.
METHODS: Gene expressions of ASCs cultured in complete medium, ASCs cultured in
serum-deprived medium and ASCs stimulated with VEGF in serum-deprived medium were
compared. ASC characteristics according to criteria set by the International
Society of Cellular Therapy were confirmed by flow cytometry. Microarray gene
expressions were obtained using the Affymetrix HT HG-U133+ GeneChip®. Gene set
enrichment analysis was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes and gene ontology terms. Transcription of selected genes of interest was 
confirmed by quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: Compared to ASCs in complete medium, 190 and 108 genes were
significantly altered by serum deprivation and serum deprivation combined with
VEGF, respectively. No significant differences in gene expression patterns
between serum-deprived ASCs and serum-deprived ASCs combined with VEGF
stimulation were found. Genes most prominently and significantly upregulated by
both conditions were growth factors (IGF1, BMP6, PDGFD, FGF9), adhesion molecule 
CLSTN2, extracellular matrix-related proteins such as matricellular proteins
SMOC2, SPON1 and ADAMTS12, and inhibitors of proliferation (JAG1). The most
significantly downregulated genes included matrix metalloproteinases (MMP3,
MMP1), and proliferation markers (CDKN3) and GREM2 (a BMP6 antagonist).
CONCLUSION: The decisive factor for the observed change in ASC gene expression
proves to be serum starvation rather than VEGF stimulation. Changes in expression
of growth factors, matricellular proteins and matrix metalloproteinases in
concert, diverge from direct pro-angiogenic paracrine mechanisms as a primary
consequence of the used protocol. In vitro serum starvation (with or without VEGF
present) appears to favour cardioprotection, extracellular matrix remodelling and
blood vessel maturation relevant for the late maturation phase in infarct
healing.

F-spondin is a pericellular matrix protein upregulated in developing growth plate
cartilage and articular cartilage during osteoarthritis. To address its function 
in bone and cartilage in vivo, we generated mice that were deficient for the
F-spondin gene, Spon1. Spon1-/- mice were viable and developed normally to
adulthood with no major skeletal abnormalities. At 6 months, femurs and tibiae of
Spon1-/- mice exhibited increased bone mass, evidenced by histological staining
and micro CT analyses, which persisted up to 12 months. In contrast, no major
abnormalities were observed in articular cartilage at any age group.
Immunohistochemical staining of femurs and tibiae revealed increased levels of
periostin, alkaline phosphate and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)
activity in the growth plate region of Spon1-/- mice, suggesting elevated bone
synthesis and turnover. However, there were no differences in serum levels of
TRAP, the bone resorption marker, CTX-1, or osteoclast differentiation potential 
between genotypes. Knockout mice also exhibited reduced levels of TGF-β1 in serum
and cultured costal chondrocytes relative to wild type. This was accompanied by
increased levels of the BMP-regulatory SMADs, P-SMAD1/5 in tibiae and
chondrocytes. Our findings indicate a previously unrecognized role for Spon1 as a
negative regulator of bone mass. We speculate that Spon1 deletion leads to a
local and systemic reduction of TGF-β levels resulting in increased BMP signaling
and increased bone deposition in adult mice.

Profiling of temporal changes of gene expression in the same kidney over the
course of renal disease progression is challenging because repeat renal biopsies 
are rarely indicated in clinical practice. Here, we profiled the temporal change 
in renal transcriptome of HIV-1 transgenic mice (Tg26), an animal model for human
HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), and their littermates at three different time
points (4, 8, and 12 weeks of age) representing early, middle, and late stages of
renal disease by serial kidney biopsy. We analyzed both static levels of gene
expression at three stages of disease and dynamic changes in gene expression
between different stages. Analysis of static and dynamic changes in gene
expression revealed that up-regulated genes at the early and middle stages are
mostly involved in immune response and inflammation, whereas down-regulated genes
mostly related to fatty acid and retinoid metabolisms. We validated the
expression of a selected panel of genes that are up-regulated at the early stage 
(CCL2, CCL5, CXCL11, Ubd, Anxa1, and Spon1) by real-time PCR. Among these
up-regulated genes, Spon1, which is a previously identified candidate gene for
hypertension, was found to be up-regulated in kidney of human with diabetic
nephropathy. Immunostaining of human biopsy samples demonstrated that protein
expression of Spon1 was also markedly increased in kidneys of patients with both 
early and late HIVAN and diabetic nephropathy. Our studies suggest that analysis 
of both static and dynamic changes of gene expression profiles in disease
progression avails another layer of information that could be utilized to gain a 
more comprehensive understanding of disease progression and identify potential
biomarkers and drug targets.

BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a high-grade glioma with poor
prognosis. Identification of new biomarkers specific to GBM could help in disease
diagnosis. We have developed and validated a bioinformatics method to predict
proteins likely to be suitable as glioma biomarkers via a global microarray
meta-analysis to identify uncharacterized genes consistently coexpressed with
known glioma-associated genes.
METHODS: A novel bioinformatics method was implemented called global microarray
meta-analysis, using approximately 16,000 microarray experiments to identify
uncharacterized genes consistently coexpressed with known glioma-associated
genes. These novel biomarkers were validated as proteins highly expressed in
human gliomas varying in tumor grades using immunohistochemistry. Glioma gene
databases were used to assess delineation of expression of these markers in
varying glioma grades and subtypes of GBM.
RESULTS: We have identified 5 potential biomarkers-spondin1, Plexin-B2, SLIT3,
fibulin-1, and LINGO1-that were validated as proteins highly expressed on the
surface of human gliomas using immunohistochemistry. Expression of spondin1,
Plexin-B2, and SLIT3 was significantly higher (P < .01) in high-grade gliomas
than in low-grade gliomas. These biomarkers were significant discriminators in
grade IV gliomas compared with either grade III or II tumors and also
distinguished between GBM subclasses.
CONCLUSIONS: This study strongly suggests that this type of bioinformatics
approach has high translational potential to rapidly discern which poorly
characterized proteins may be of clinical relevance.

We describe a novel bioinformatic and translational pathology approach, gene
Signature Finder Algorithm (gSFA) to identify biomarkers associated with
Colorectal Cancer (CRC) survival. Here a robust set of CRC markers is selected by
an ensemble method. By using a dataset of 232 gene expression profiles, gSFA
discovers 16 highly significant small gene signatures. Analysis of dichotomies
generated by the signatures results in a set of 133 samples stably classified in 
good prognosis group and 56 samples in poor prognosis group, whereas 43 remain
unreliably classified. AKAP12, DCBLD2, NT5E and SPON1 are particularly
represented in the signatures and selected for validation in vivo on two
independent patients cohorts comprising 140 tumor tissues and 60 matched normal
tissues. Their expression and regulatory programs are investigated in vitro. We
show that the coupled expression of NT5E and DCBLD2 robustly stratifies our
patients in two groups (one of which with 100% survival at five years). We show
that NT5E is a target of the TNF-α signaling in vitro; the tumor suppressor PPARγ
acts as a novel NT5E antagonist that positively and concomitantly regulates
DCBLD2 in a cancer cell context-dependent manner.

AIM: To develop novel biomarkers of rectal radiotherapy, we measured gene
expression profiles on biopsies taken before and during preoperative
radiotherapy.
METHODS: Six patients presenting with a locally advanced rectal cancer (T>T2,
N0/Nx, M0) eligible for preoperative radiotherapy (45 Gy in 25 fractions) were
selected in a pilot study. Six tumor and 3 normal tissues biopsies were taken
before and during radiotherapy, after a dose of 7.2 Gy at a median time of 1 h
following irradiation (0:27-2:12). Tumor or normal tissue purity was assessed by 
a pathologist prior to RNA extraction. Mean RNA content was 23 μg/biopsy (14-37) 
before radiotherapy and 22.7 μg/biopsy (12-35) during radiotherapy. After RNA
amplification, biopsies were analysed with 54K HG-U133A Plus 2.0 Affymetrix
expression micro-arrays. Data were normalized according to MAS5 algorithm. A gene
expression ratio was calculated as: (gene expression during radiotherapy - gene
expression before radiotherapy)/gene expression before radiotherapy. Were
selected genes that showed a ratio higher than ± 0.5 in all 6 patients.
RESULTS: Microarray analysis showed that preoperative radiotherapy significantly 
up-regulated 31 genes and down-regulated 6 genes. According to the Gene Ontology 
project classification, these genes are involved in protein metabolism (ADAMDEC1;
AKAP7; CAPN5; CLIC5; CPE; CREB3L1; NEDD4L; RAB27A), ion transport (AKAP7; ATP2A3;
CCL28; CLIC5; F2RL2; NEDD4L; SLC6A8), transcription (AKAP7; CREB3L1; ISX;
PABPC1L; TXNIP), signal transduction (CAPN5; F2RL2; RAB27A; TNFRSF11A), cell
adhesion (ADAMDEC1; PXDN; SPON1; S100A2), immune response (CCL28; PXDN;
TNFRSF11A) and apoptosis (ITM2C; PDCD4; PVT1). Up-regulation of 3 genes (CCL28;
CLIC5; PDCD4) was detected by 2 different probes and up-regulation of 2 genes
(RAB27A; TXNIP) by 3 probes.
CONCLUSION: Micro-arrays can efficiently assess early transcriptomic changes
during preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer, and may help better
understand tumor radioresistance.

BACKGROUND: Substantial interindividual variability exists in the disease
trajectories of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Some decline rapidly whereas
others decline slowly, and there are no known explanations for this variability. 
We describe the first genome-wide association study to examine rate of cognitive 
decline in a sample of AD patients with longitudinal measures of cognition.
METHODS: The discovery sample was 303 AD cases recruited in the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the replication sample was 323 AD cases from 
the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. In the discovery
sample, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale responses were
tested for association with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data
using linear regression. We tested the 65 most significant SNPs from the
discovery sample for association in the replication sample.
RESULTS: We identified SNPs in the spondin 1 gene (SPON1), the minor alleles of
which were significantly associated with a slower rate of decline (rs11023139,
P = 7.0 × 10(-11)) in the discovery sample. A SPON1 SNP 5.5 kb upstream was
associated with decline in the replication sample (rs11606345, P = .002).
CONCLUSION: SPON1 has not been previously associated with AD risk, but is
plausibly related because the gene product binds to the amyloid precursor protein
and inhibits its cleavage by β-secretase. These data suggest that SPON1 may be
associated with the differential rate of cognitive decline in AD.

It is well established that lncRNAs are aberrantly expressed in cancer where they
have been shown to act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. RNA profiling of 314
colorectal adenomas/adenocarcinomas and 292 adjacent normal colon mucosa samples 
using RNA-sequencing demonstrated that the snoRNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) is
significantly up-regulated in adenomas and all stages of CRC. SNHG16 expression
was positively correlated to the expression of Wnt-regulated transcription
factors, including ASCL2, ETS2, and c-Myc. In vitro abrogation of Wnt signaling
in CRC cells reduced the expression of SNHG16 indicating that SNHG16 is regulated
by the Wnt pathway. Silencing of SNHG16 resulted in reduced viability, increased 
apoptotic cell death and impaired cell migration. The SNHG16 silencing
particularly affected expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. A
connection between SNHG16 and genes involved in lipid metabolism was also
observed in clinical tumors. Argonaute CrossLinking and ImmunoPrecipitation
(AGO-CLIP) demonstrated that SNHG16 heavily binds AGO and has 27 AGO/miRNA target
sites along its length, indicating that SNHG16 may act as a competing endogenous 
RNA (ceRNA) "sponging" miRNAs off their cognate targets. Most interestingly, half
of the miRNA families with high confidence targets on SNHG16 also target the
3'UTR of Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase (SCD). SCD is involved in lipid metabolism and
is down-regulated upon SNHG16 silencing. In conclusion, up-regulation of SNHG16
is a frequent event in CRC, likely caused by deregulated Wnt signaling. In vitro 
analyses demonstrate that SNHG16 may play an oncogenic role in CRC and that it
affects genes involved in lipid metabolism, possible through ceRNA related
mechanisms.

The function of the vast majority of mammalian long noncoding (lnc) RNAs remains 
unknown. Here, analysis of a highly abundant mammalian lncRNA, OIP5-AS1, known as
cyrano in zebrafish, revealed that OIP5-AS1 reduces cell proliferation. In human 
cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, the RNA-binding protein HuR, which enhances cell
proliferation, associated with OIP5-AS1 and stabilized it. Tagging OIP5-AS1 with 
MS2 hairpins to identify associated microRNAs revealed that miR-424 interacted
with OIP5-AS1 and competed with HuR for binding to OIP5-AS1. We further
identified a 'sponge' function for OIP5-AS1, as high levels of OIP5-AS1 increased
HuR-OIP5-AS1 complexes and prevented HuR interaction with target mRNAs, including
those that encoded proliferative proteins, while conversely, lowering OIP5-AS1
increased the abundance of HuR complexes with target mRNAs. We propose that
OIP5-AS1 serves as a sponge or a competing endogenous (ce)RNA for HuR,
restricting its availability to HuR target mRNAs and thereby repressing
HuR-elicited proliferative phenotypes.

Thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified in mammalian
cells. Some have important functions and their dysregulation can contribute to a 
variety of disease states. However, most lncRNAs have not been functionally
characterized. Complicating their study, lncRNAs have widely varying subcellular 
distributions: some reside predominantly in the nucleus, the cytoplasm or in both
compartments. One method to query function is to suppress expression and examine 
the resulting phenotype. Methods to suppress expression of mRNAs include
antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and RNA interference (RNAi). Antisense and
RNAi-based gene-knockdown methods vary in efficacy between different cellular
compartments. It is not known if this affects their ability to suppress lncRNAs. 
To address whether localization of the lncRNA influences susceptibility to
degradation by either ASOs or RNAi, nuclear lncRNAs (MALAT1 and NEAT1),
cytoplasmic lncRNAs (DANCR and OIP5-AS1) and dual-localized lncRNAs (TUG1, CasC7 
and HOTAIR) were compared for knockdown efficiency. We found that nuclear lncRNAs
were more effectively suppressed using ASOs, cytoplasmic lncRNAs were more
effectively suppressed using RNAi and dual-localized lncRNAs were suppressed
using both methods. A mixed-modality approach combining ASOs and RNAi reagents
improved knockdown efficacy, particularly for those lncRNAs that localize to both
nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments.

The BCL6 gene is frequently disrupted at its 5' noncoding region by 3q27
chromosomal translocations in B-cell lymphoma. As a result of translocation, BCL6
is juxtaposed to reciprocal partners, such as the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene
family. Besides the Ig loci, multiple non-Ig partners of the BCL6 translocation
have been reported. Here we describe the identification of the GAS5 (growth
arrest-specific transcript 5) gene as a novel partner of the BCL6 in a patient
with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, harboring the t(1;3)(q25;q27). In this case, 
the chromosome 1 breakpoint was located within the intronic small nucleolar RNA
(snoRNA) sequence of GAS5 and the chromosome 3 breakpoint at 4 kb upstream of
BCL6 exon 1a. As the result of chromosomal translocation, the GAS5-BCL6 chimeric 
transcripts were expressed, in which the 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine (5'TOP)
sequence of GAS5 was fused to the whole coding sequence of BCL6. The GAS5 gene on
chromosome 1q25 is the second BCL6 partner, to the SNHG5 on 6q15, which is
classified as a non-protein-coding multiple snoRNA host and 5'-TOP class gene.

Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon resulting in
parent-of-origin-specific gene expression that is regulated by a differentially
methylated region. Gene mutations or failures in the imprinting process lead to
the development of imprinting disorders, such as Angelman syndrome. The symptoms 
of Angelman syndrome are caused by the absence of functional UBE3A protein in
neurons of the brain. To create a human neuronal model for Angelman syndrome, we 
reprogrammed dermal fibroblasts of a patient carrying a defined three-base pair
deletion in UBE3A into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In these iPSCs,
both parental alleles are present, distinguishable by the mutation, and express
UBE3A. Detailed characterization of these iPSCs demonstrated their pluripotency
and exceptional stability of the differentially methylated region regulating
imprinted UBE3A expression. We observed strong induction of SNHG14 and silencing 
of paternal UBE3A expression only late during neuronal differentiation, in vitro.
This new Angelman syndrome iPSC line allows to study imprinted gene regulation on
both parental alleles and to dissect molecular pathways affected by the absence
of UBE3A protein.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive type of breast cancer with 
unfavorable outcome. It is urgent to explore novel biomarkers and potential
therapeutic targets in this malignancy. Increasing knowledge of long noncoding
RNAs (lncRNAs) significantly deepens our understanding of cancer biology. Here,
we sequenced eight paired TNBC tumor tissues and non-cancerous tissues, and
validated significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs. Gene ontology (GO) and 
pathway analysis were used to investigate the function of differentially
expressed mRNAs. Further, potential core lncRNAs in TNBC were identified by
co-expression networks. Kaplan-Meier analysis also indicated that breast cancer
patients with lower expression level of rhabdomyosarcoma 2 associated transcript 
(RMST), one of the potential core lncRNAs, had worse overall survival. To the
best of our knowledge, it was the first report that RMST was involved in breast
cancer. Our research provided a rich resource to the research community for
further investigating lncRNAs functions and identifying lncRNAs with diagnostic
and therapeutic potentials in TNBC.

BACKGROUND: Brain size and patterning are dependent on dosage-sensitive morphogen
signaling pathways - yet how these pathways are calibrated remains enigmatic.
Recent studies point to a new role for microRNAs in tempering the spatio-temporal
range of morphogen functions during development. Here, we investigated the role
of miR-135a, derived from the mir-135a-2 locus, in embryonic forebrain
development.
METHOD: 1. We characterized the expression of miR-135a, and its host gene Rmst,
by in situ hybridization (ish). 2. We conditionally ablated, or activated,
beta-catenin in the dorsal forebrain to determine if this pathway was necessary
and/or sufficient for Rmst/miR-135a expression. 3. We performed bioinformatics
analysis to unveil the most predicted pathways targeted by miR-135a. 4. We
performed gain and loss of function experiments on mir-135a-2 and analyzed by ish
the expression of key markers of cortical hem, choroid plexus, neocortex and
hippocampus.
RESULTS: 1. miR-135a, embedded in the host long non-coding transcript Rmst, is
robustly expressed, and functional, in the medial wall of the embryonic dorsal
forebrain, a Wnt and TGFβ/BMP-rich domain. 2. Canonical Wnt/beta-catenin
signaling is critical for the expression of Rmst and miR-135a, and the cortical
hem determinant Lmx1a. 3. Bioinformatics analyses reveal that the Wnt and
TGFβ/BMP cascades are among the top predicted pathways targeted by miR-135a. 4.
Analysis of mir-135a-2 null embryos showed that dorsal forebrain development
appeared normal. In contrast, modest mir-135a-2 overexpression, in the early
dorsal forebrain, resulted in a phenotype resembling that of mutants with Wnt and
TGFβ/BMP deficits - a smaller cortical hem and hippocampus primordium associated 
with a shorter neocortex as well as a less convoluted choroid plexus.
Interestingly, late overexpression of mir-135a-2 revealed no change.
CONCLUSIONS: All together, our data suggests the existence of a Wnt/miR-135a
auto-regulatory loop, which could serve to limit the extent, the duration and/or 
intensity of the Wnt and, possibly, the TGFβ/BMP pathways.

Genetic and epigenetic control of metabolic health.

Schwenk RW, Vogel H, Schürmann A.

Obesity is characterized as an excess accumulation of body fat resulting from a
positive energy balance. It is the major risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D).
The evidence for familial aggregation of obesity and its associated metabolic
diseases is substantial. To date, about 150 genetic loci identified in
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are linked with obesity and T2D, each
accounting for only a small proportion of the predicted heritability. However,
the percentage of overall trait variance explained by these associated loci is
modest (~5-10% for T2D, ~2% for BMI). The lack of powerful genetic associations
suggests that heritability is not entirely attributable to gene variations. Some 
of the familial aggregation as well as many of the effects of environmental
exposures, may reflect epigenetic processes. This review summarizes our current
knowledge on the genetic basis to individual risk of obesity and T2D, and
explores the potential role of epigenetic contribution.

Biopolis Street, Singapore 138672, Singapore.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abundant in the mammalian transcriptome, and
many are specifically expressed in the brain. We have identified a group of
lncRNAs, including rhabdomyosarcoma 2-associated transcript (RMST), which are
indispensable for neurogenesis. Here, we provide mechanistic insight into the
role of human RMST in modulating neurogenesis. RMST expression is specific to the
brain, regulated by the transcriptional repressor REST, and increases during
neuronal differentiation, indicating a role in neurogenesis. RMST physically
interacts with SOX2, a transcription factor known to regulate neural fate. RMST
and SOX2 coregulate a large pool of downstream genes implicated in neurogenesis. 
Through RNA interference and genome-wide SOX2 binding studies, we found that RMST
is required for the binding of SOX2 to promoter regions of neurogenic
transcription factors. These results establish the role of RMST as a
transcriptional coregulator of SOX2 and a key player in the regulation of neural 
stem cell fate.

Common and rare variants associated with body mass index (BMI) and obesity
account for <5% of the variance in BMI. We performed SNP and copy number
variation (CNV) association analyses in 1,509 children with obesity at the
extreme tail (>3 s.d. from the mean) of the BMI distribution and 5,380 controls. 
Evaluation of 29 SNPs (P < 1 × 10(-5)) in an additional 971 severely obese
children and 1,990 controls identified 4 new loci associated with severe obesity 
(LEPR, PRKCH, PACS1 and RMST). A previously reported 43-kb deletion at the NEGR1 
locus was significantly associated with severe obesity (P = 6.6 × 10(-7)).
However, this signal was entirely driven by a flanking 8-kb deletion; absence of 
this deletion increased risk for obesity (P = 6.1 × 10(-11)). We found a
significant burden of rare, single CNVs in severely obese cases (P < 0.0001).
Integrative gene network pathway analysis of rare deletions indicated enrichment 
of genes affecting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the neuronal
regulation of energy homeostasis.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMST) is an important cause of morbidity and
mortality in people and dogs in the United States. Disease manifestations are
strikingly similar in both species, and illness in dogs can precede illness in
people. R. rickettsii has been identified as a Select Agent by the CDC as a
Category C priority pathogen by the National Institute of Allergic and Infectious
Diseases because it is amenable to use as a bioterror agent. The clinical and
temporal relationship of naturally occurring diseases in dogs and people suggests
that dogs could serve as sentinels for natural infection and bioterrorist attacks
using this organism. Recognizing genetic modifications in naturally occurring
disease agents in order to distinguish them from intentionally released agents
are priorities put forth by the NIAID. To determine whether the rickettsiae
naturally infecting dogs is the same as those that infect persons in a given
geographical region, we characterized rickettsial isolates obtained from three
dogs and two persons diagnosed with RMSF in North Carolina. Portions of three
genes (ompA, rrs, and gltA) amplified by PCR were cloned and sequenced or
directly sequenced. Reactions were run in duplicate in forward and reverse
directions. Gene sequences were aligned with known sequences deposited in GenBank
and with each other. Sequences of the 5' region of the ompA gene were 100%
homologous with a tick strain (Bitterroot) of R. rickettsii for all five
isolates. Sequences of the rrs gene were 99.8 99.9% homologous with a tick strain
(Sawtooth) of R. rickettsii. rrs gene sequences from one dog and the two persons 
was identical. Sequences of one dog isolate differed from these by one base pair.
Sequences from another dog isolate differed by two base pairs. Sequences of the
gltA gene are pending. This confirms on a molecular level that R. rickettsii
causing naturally occurring RMSF in dogs in North Carolina is highly homologous
to R. rickettsii that causes the disease in people in the same region. Sequence
data will be deposited in GenBank, thereby providing genetic information
regarding naturally occurring R. rickettsii.

Cell-type specific gene silencing by histone H3 lysine 27 and lysine 9
methyltransferase complexes PRC2 and G9A-GLP is crucial both during development
and to maintain cell identity. Although studying their interaction partners has
yielded valuable insight into their functions, how these factors are regulated on
a network level remains incompletely understood. Here, we present a new approach 
that combines quantitative interaction proteomics with global chromatin profiling
to functionally characterize repressive chromatin modifying protein complexes in 
embryonic stem cells. We define binding stoichiometries of 9 new and 12 known
interaction partners of PRC2 and 10 known and 29 new interaction partners of
G9A-GLP, respectively. We demonstrate that PRC2 and G9A-GLP interact physically
and share several interaction partners, including the zinc finger proteins
ZNF518A and ZNF518B. Using global chromatin profiling by targeted mass
spectrometry, we discover that even sub-stoichiometric binding partners such as
ZNF518B can positively regulate global H3K9me2 levels. Biochemical analysis
reveals that ZNF518B directly interacts with EZH2 and G9A. Our systematic
analysis suggests that ZNF518B may mediate the structural association between
PRC2 and G9A-GLP histone methyltransferases and additionally regulates the
activity of G9A-GLP.

The recently discovered long noncoding RNAs have the potential to regulate many
biological processes, which are aberrantly expressed in many tumor types. Our
previous study showed that the long noncoding RNA-growth arrest-specific
transcript 5 (GAS5) was decreased in lung cancer tissue, which contributed to the
proliferation and apoptosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). GAS5 was also
associated with the prognosis of lung cancer patients. These results suggest that
GAS5 may represent a novel prognostic indicator and a target for gene therapy in 
NSCLC. However, the expression and diagnosis significance of GAS5 in the plasma
of NSCLC patients was unknown. The plasma samples were more readily available
than the tissue samples in clinical, so we designed the study to investigate the 
diagnosis value of GAS5 in blood samples. In our study, 90 patients with NSCLC
and 33 healthy controls were included. Blood samples were collected before
surgery and therapy. We extracted the free RNA in the plasma and analyzed the
expression of GAS5 with quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Suitable
statistics methods were used to compare the plasma GAS5 levels of preoperative
and postoperative plasma samples between the NSCLC patients and healthy controls.
Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the
diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of plasma GAS5 in NSCLC. The results
showed that GAS5 was detectable and stable in the plasma of NSCLC patients.
Furthermore, the plasma levels of GAS5 were significantly down-regulated in NSCLC
patients compared with healthy controls (P = 0.000). Moreover, GAS5 levels
increased markedly on the seventh day after surgery compared with preoperative
GAS5 levels in NSCLC patients (P = 0.003). GAS5 expression levels could be used
to distinguish NSCLC patients from control patients with an area under the curve 
of 0.832 (P < 0.0001; sensitivity, 82.2%; specificity, 72.7%). The combination of
the GAS5 and carcinoembryonic antigen could produce an area of 0.909 under the
receiver-operating characteristic curve in distinguishing NSCLC patients from
control subjects (95% confidence interval 0.857-0.962, P = 0.000). We have
demonstrated that GAS5 expression was decreased in NSCLC Plasma. Plasma samples
were more accessible than tissue samples in clinical; therefore, GAS5 could be an
ideal biomarker for the diagnosis of NSCLC.

Breastmilk has many documented beneficial effects on the developing human infant,
but the components of breastmilk that influence these developmental pathways have
not been fully elucidated. Increasing evidence suggests that non-coding RNAs
encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent an important mechanism of 
communication between the mother and child. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are of
particular interest given their key role in gene expression and development.
However, it is not known whether breastmilk EVs contain lncRNAs. We used qRT-PCR 
to determine whether EVs isolated from human breastmilk contain lncRNAs
previously reported to be important for developmental processes. We detected 55
of the 87 screened lncRNAs in EVs from the 30 analyzed breastmilk samples, and
CRNDE, DANCR GAS5, SRA1 and ZFAS1 were detected in >90% of the samples. GAS5,
SNHG8 and ZFAS1 levels were highly correlated (Spearman's rho>0.9; P<0.0001),
which may indicate that the loading of these lncRNAs into breastmilk EVs is
regulated by the same pathways. The detected lncRNAs are important epigenetic
regulators involved in processes such as immune cell regulation and metabolism.
They may target a repertoire of recipient cells in offspring and could be
essential for child development and health. Further experimental and
epidemiological studies are warranted to determine the impact of breastmilk
EV-encapsulated lnRNAs in mother to child signaling.

Vascular remodeling is an important pathological feature of hypertension, leading
to increased vascular resistance and reduced compliance. Endothelial cell (EC)
and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction is involved in vascular
remodeling. Long noncoding RNAs are potential regulators of EC and VSMC function.
Herein, we determined whether long noncoding RNA-growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) 
is involved in hypertension-related vascular remodeling. We revealed that GAS5
knockdown aggravated hypertension-induced microvascular dysfunction as shown by
increased retinal neovascularization and capillary leakage. GAS5 regulated the
remodeling of arteries, including caudal arteries, carotid arteries, renal
arteries, and thoracic arteries. GAS5 was mainly expressed in ECs and VSMCs, and 
its expression was significantly downregulated in hypertension. GAS5 knockdown
affected endothelial activation, endothelial proliferation, VSMC phenotypic
conversion, and EC-VSMC communication in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, GAS5
regulated EC and VSMC function through β-catenin signaling. This study identified
GAS5 as a critical regulator in hypertension and demonstrated the potential of
gene therapy and drug development for treating hypertension.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease of the arterial wall and a leading cause of 
death worldwide. Though the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic lesion formation
has been studied, we still lack evidence of the global changes in the artery
during atherosclerosis. In this report, we induced atherosclerosis in rats and
conducted GeneChip analysis on carotid arteries with or without plaque formation.
We found that molecular pathways underlying plaque formation in atherosclerosis
were related to immune response, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis and 
hypoxic microenvironments, suggesting that the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis
is varied. In addition, we showed that three lncRNAs, GAS5, SNHG6 and Zfas1, were
significantly increased in the plaque of atherosclerosis patients compared to
normal people. A complex interaction of mRNA and lncRNA was identified in
atherosclerosis. Our results provide a global transcriptomic network of
atherosclerosis development in rats and possible targets that could lead to new
clinical applications in the future.

PURPOSE: Gastric cancer ranks as the most common cancer in the world. However,
the progresses of its diagnosis and treatment are still not satisfactory. The
purpose of this study is to summarize the roles of lncRNAs associated with
gastric cancer.
METHODS: We searched lncRNAs associated with gastric cancer in PubMed.
RESULTS: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), transcripts larger than 200 nucleotides, 
regulate gene expression at various levels. They are playing important roles in
the occurrence and development of gastric cancer. They are involved in signaling 
pathways, crosstalk with microRNAs, and affecting metastasis by regulating
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. By acting as oncogenes or tumor
suppressors, lncRNAs contribute to gastric cancer occurrence and development.
Several lncRNAs including HOTAIR, HULC, LINC00152, MALAT2, H19, GHET1, and GACAT3
have been demonstrated having oncogene activities, while other lncRNAs including 
LEIGC, GAS5, and FER1L4 have been thought as tumor suppressors.
CONCLUSIONS: Several lncRNAs from tissue, blood, and gastric juice have shown
potential values in gastric cancer diagnosis or prognosis evaluation.

in Autoimmune and Inflammatory Diseases.

Glucocorticoids have strong regulatory actions on the immune system and act as
potent therapeutic compounds for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We
previously reported that the long noncoding RNA growth arrest-specific 5 (Gas5), 
which accumulates inside the cells in response to cellular starvation/growth
arrest, functions as a potent repressor of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
through its RNA "glucocorticoid response element (GRE)". To evaluate potential
roles of Gas5 in immune-related disorders, we examined Gas5 RNA levels in various
autoimmune, inflammatory, and infectious diseases using the microarray data
available in the Gene Expression Omnibus. We found that Gas5 levels were altered 
in whole blood or leukocytes of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic 
lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and sarcoidosis. Gas5 levels were also
altered in infectious diseases, such as by the human immunodeficiency virus
type-1 and influenza virus, and bacterial sepsis. In our experimental analysis
using mice, Gas5 levels were kept at high basal levels and did not respond to
fasting in immune organs, such as spleen and thymus, while its levels in
metabolic organs, including liver, fat, and skeletal muscles, were low at
baseline and were highly elevated upon this treatment, possibly through
suppression of the mTOR pathway. These results suggest that Gas5 plays a role in 
the regulation of immune functions and pathogenesis/pathophysiology of
autoimmune, inflammatory, and infectious diseases in part through modulation of
the GR transcriptional activity via its decoy RNA "GRE". Changes in the Gas5
levels may also influence disease response to immunosuppressive glucocorticoid
therapy.

This study evaluates the association between the long noncoding RNA GAS5 levels
and the anti-proliferative effect of the glucocorticoid (GC) methylprednisolone
(MP) alone and in combination with rapamycin in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy donors. The effect of MP, rapamycin, and MP
plus rapamycin was determined in 17 healthy donors by labelling metabolically
active cells with [methyl-3H] thymidine and the expression levels of GAS5 gene
were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR TaqMan analysis. We confirmed a role for GAS5 
in modulating GC response: poor responders presented higher levels of GAS5 in
comparison with good responders. Interestingly, when PBMCs were treated with the 
combination of rapamycin plus MP, the high levels of GAS5 observed for each drug 
in the MP poor responders group decreased in comparison with rapamycin (P
value = 0.0134) or MP alone (P value = 0.0193). GAS5 is involved in GC resistance
and co-treatment of rapamycin with GCs restores GC effectiveness in poor
responders through the downregulation of the long noncoding RNA. GAS5 could be
considered a biomarker to personalize therapy and a novel therapeutic target
useful for the development of new pharmacological approaches to restore GC
sensitivity.

HCV infection has a complex and dynamic process which involves a large number of 
viral and host factors. Long non-coding RNA GAS5 inhibits liver fibrosis and
liver tumor migration and invasion. However, the contribution of GAS5 on HCV
infection remains unknown. In this study, GAS5 was gradually upregulated during
HCV infection in Huh7 cells. In addition, GAS5 attenuated virus replication with 
its 5' end sequences, as confirmed by different GAS5 truncations. Moreover, this 
5' end sequences showed RNA-protein interaction with HCV NS3 protein that could
act as a decoy to inhibit its functions, which contributed to the suppression of 
HCV replication. Finally, the innate immune responses remained low in HCV
infected Huh7 cells, ruling out the possibility of GAS5 to modulate innate
immunity. Thus, HCV stimulated endogenous GAS5 can suppress HCV infection by
acting as HCV NS3 protein decoy, providing a potential role of GAS5 as a
diagnostic or therapeutic target.

As one of the most common malignancies, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)
is ranked as the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. In our
previous study, by employing cDNA microarray analysis, semaphorin 3B (SEMA3B) was
found to be significantly downregulated in ESCC. In the present study, SEMA3B
downregulation at the mRNA level was found in 34 of 60 primary ESCCs (56.7%) and 
in 6 of 9 ESCC cell lines (66.7%) by transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR). Moreover, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of SEMA3B in a tissue
microarray further indicated that downregulated expression of SEMA3B protein was 
found in 125 of 222 (56.3%) ESCC cases and downregulation of SEMA3B protein was
significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.000), advanced
clinicopathological stage (P=0.001) and poor disease-specific survival (P=0.017) 
of ESCC patients. In addition, functional studies demonstrated that the SEMA3B
gene could suppress the tumorigenic ability of ESCC cells and cell motility.
Furthermore, it was found that by upregulating p53 and p21 expression and
inhibiting Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation, SEMA3B could induce cell cycle arrest at
G1/S phase. Taken together, our results suggest that SEMA3B may be an important
tumor-suppressor gene in the malignant progression of ESCC, as well as a valuable
prognostic marker for ESCC patients.

In the developing mammalian brain, neural network formation is regulated by
complex signaling cascades. In utero and lactational dioxin exposure is known to 
induce higher brain function abnormalities and dendritic growth disruption in
rodents. However, it is unclear whether perinatal dioxin exposure affects the
expression of genes involved in neural network formation. Therefore, we
investigated changes in gene expression in the brain regions of developing mice
born to dams administered 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD; dose: 0,
0.6, or 3.0 μg/kg) on gestational day 12.5. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that TCDD 
exposure induced Ahrr expression in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and
olfactory bulb of 3-day-old mice. Gene microarray analysis indicated that the
mRNA expression levels of Sema3b and Sema3g, which encode proteins that are known
to control axonal projections, were elevated in the olfactory bulb of
TCDD-exposed mice, and the induction of these genes was observed during a 2-week 
postnatal period. Increased Sema3g expression was also observed in the brain but 
not in the kidney, liver, lung, and spleen of TCDD-exposed neonatal mice. These
results indicate that the Sema3b and Sema3g genes are sensitive to brain-specific
induction by dioxin exposure, which may disrupt neural network formation in the
mammalian nervous system, thereby leading to abnormal higher brain function in
adulthood.

The aim of the current study was to explore mechanisms of SEMA3B gene expression 
and its clinical significance in glioma, and provide a theoretical foundation for
investigating individualized treatment in glioma. Paraffin-embedded tissues from 
43 patients with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of glioma following neurosurgery 
at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from December 2013 to
April 2014 were selected randomly. An additional three normal brain tissues were 
obtained following encephalic decompression excision due to acute craniocerebral 
injury in the same period, which were used as the control group.
Immunohistochemical staining for vascular endothelial growth factor was performed
on the glioma tissues from the 43 patients. Genomic DNA was extracted for
bisulfate conversion and sequencing. SEMA3B was fully expressed in the three
normal brain tissues, and incompletely expressed in the 43 glioma tissues, with a
lack of expression in 48.8% (21/43) of samples. Moreover, 58% of high-grade
gliomas (grade III and IV) lacked SEMA3B expression, which was significantly more
than those that lacked expression (20%) in low-grade gliomas (grade I and II),
indicating that, as the clinical pathological grade increased, SEMA3B expression 
decreased. The occurrence and development of malignant tumors is a product of
multiple genes and other factors. Here, we provide theoretical basis for glioma
development and prognosis involving DNA-methylation driven silencing of SEMA3B,
and thus, SEMA3B is a potential target for directed treatments against glioma.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship of
serum vitamin D deficiency (VDD) to histologic features of non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD), and associated demographic, clinical, laboratory, and
transcriptomic data in the well-characterized Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis
Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) cohort.
METHODS: Serum vitamin D 25(OH)D (VD) was quantified by liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 190 adults (>18 years) with
biopsy-proven NAFLD. Subjects were categorized according to their level of VD as 
either sufficient (>30 ng/ml), insufficient (≥20≤30 ng/ml), or deficient (VDD;
<20 ng/ml). Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the
association of VDD and the presence of definite NASH and individual histological 
features of NAFLD after adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, alanine
aminotransferase, and diabetes status. Hepatic transcriptomic data was compared
between VDD and non-VDD subjects.
RESULTS: VDD was present in 55% of subjects and was independently associated with
definitive NASH (odds ratio (OR) 3.15, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.62-6.15,
P=0.001), increased lobular inflammation (OR=1.98, 95% CI, 1.08-3.61, P=0.026),
more ballooning (OR=2.38, 95% CI, 1.32-4.30, P=0.004), and the presence of
fibrosis (OR=2.32, 95% CI, 1.13-4.77, P=0.022). There was a significant inverse
relationship between lower levels of serum resistin and increased VD level
category (P=0.013). The KRT10, SEMA3B, SNORD3C, ARSD, and IGKV4-1 genes were
differentially expressed (false discovery rate <0.05) between VDD and non-VDD
subjects. Gene ontology and pathway analysis suggest activation of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-κB pathways in VDD NAFLD
subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: VDD is prevalent among US adult NAFLD patients and is independently 
associated with a definitive diagnosis of NASH and increased histological
severity. Novel associations in proinflammatory pathways were identified, which
suggest the mechanism for VDD in the pathogenesis of NASH and support dietary
and/or lifestyle modifications to increase vitamin D levels in these patients.

Commissural axon guidance depends on a myriad of cues expressed by intermediate
targets. Secreted semaphorins signal through neuropilin-2/plexin-A1 receptor
complexes on post-crossing commissural axons to mediate floor plate repulsion in 
the mouse spinal cord. Here, we show that neuropilin-2/plexin-A1 are also
coexpressed on commissural axons prior to midline crossing and can mediate
precrossing semaphorin-induced repulsion in vitro. How premature
semaphorin-induced repulsion of precrossing axons is suppressed in vivo is not
known. We discovered that a novel source of floor plate-derived, but not
axon-derived, neuropilin-2 is required for precrossing axon pathfinding. Floor
plate-specific deletion of neuropilin-2 significantly reduces the presence of
precrossing axons in the ventral spinal cord, which can be rescued by inhibiting 
plexin-A1 signaling in vivo. Our results show that floor plate-derived
neuropilin-2 is developmentally regulated, functioning as a molecular sink to
sequester semaphorins, preventing premature repulsion of precrossing axons prior 
to subsequent down-regulation, and allowing for semaphorin-mediated repulsion of 
post-crossing axons.

The methylation of promoter CpG islands and interactions between microRNAs
(miRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of target genes are considered two crucial
epigenetic mechanisms for inducing gene and pathway deregulation in tumors. Here,
the expression levels of seven cancer-associated 3p genes (RASSF1(isoform A),
RARB(isoform 2), SEMA3B, RHOA, GPX1, NKIRAS1, and CHL1) and their predicted
regulator miRNAs (miR-129-2, miR-9-1) were analyzed in breast (BC, 40 samples)
and ovarian (OC, 14 samples) cancers using RT-PCR and qPCR. We first revealed a
negative correlation between the level of the miR-129-2 precursor and RASSF1(A)
and GPX1 mRNA levels in BC (Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) was − 0.26 in
both cases). Similar results were observed for the miR-129-2 precursor and the
RASSF1(A), GPX1, RARB(2), and CHL1 genes in OC (rs was in the range − 0.48 to −
0.54). Using methylation-specific PCR, a significant correlation was shown
between promoter hypermethylation and the down-regulation of the RASSF1(A), GPX1,
RARB(2), SEMA3B, MIR-129-2, and MIR-9-1 genes in BC (rs = 0.41 to 0.75) and of
the RASSF1(A) gene in OC (rs = 0.67). We first demonstrated a high
hypermethylation frequency of MIR-129-2 and SEMA3B (up to 45 to 48%) in both BC
(69 samples) and OC (41 samples). Moreover, we observed a positive correlation
between the hypermethylation of MIR-129-2 and the up-regulation of the RASSF1(A) 
and GPX1 genes in BC (rs = 0.38 and 0.42, respectively). QPCR analysis of the
expression of RASSF1(A) and mature miR-129-2 in additional BC sample set (24
samples) revealed a negative correlation between them (rs = − 0.41) that
strengthened the results obtained during the analysis of miR-129-2 precursor
level. In summary, the obtained data indicate the involvement of methylation in
the down-regulation of the studied coding and miRNA genes and suggest the
involvement of miR-129-2 in the deregulation of RASSF1(A) via a direct
interaction or/and mediators in common pathways (according to KEGG, Gene Ontology
(FDR < 0.01), and GeneCards data) in the examined gynecological tumors.

Why is placentation abnormal in preeclampsia?

The causes of preeclampsia remain one of the great medical mysteries of our time.
This syndrome is thought to occur in 2 stages with abnormal placentation leading 
to a maternal inflammatory response. Specific regions of the placenta have
distinct pathologic features. During normal pregnancy, cytotrophoblasts emigrate 
from the chorionic villi and invade the uterus, reaching the inner third of the
myometrium. This unusual process is made even more exceptional by the fact that
the placental cells are hemiallogeneic, coexpressing maternal and paternal
genomes. Within the uterine wall, cytotrophoblasts deeply invade the spiral
arteries. Cytotrophoblasts migrate up these vessels and replace, in a retrograde 
fashion, the maternal endothelial lining. They also insert themselves among the
smooth muscle cells that form the tunica media. As a result, the spiral arteries 
attain the physiologic properties that are required to perfuse the placenta
adequately. In comparison, invasion of the venous side of the uterine circulation
is minimal, sufficient to enable venous return. In preeclampsia, cytotrophoblast 
invasion of the interstitial uterine compartment is frequently shallow, although 
not consistently so. In many locations, spiral artery invasion is incomplete.
There are many fewer endovascular cytotrophoblasts, and some vessels retain
portions of their endothelial lining with relatively intact muscular coats,
although others are not modified. Work from our group showed that these defects
mirror deficits in the differentiation program that enables cytotrophoblast
invasion of the uterine wall. During normal pregnancy, invasion is accompanied by
the down-regulation of epithelial-like molecules that are indicative of their
ectodermal origin and up-regulation of numerous receptors and ligands that
typically are expressed by endothelial or vascular smooth muscle cells. For
example, the expression of epithelial-cadherin (the cell-cell adhesion molecule
that many ectodermal derivatives use to adhere to one another) becomes nearly
undetectable, replaced by vascular-endothelial cadherin, which serves the same
purpose in blood vessels. Invading cytotrophoblasts also modulate vascular
endothelial growth factor ligands and receptors, at some point in the
differentiation process expressing every (mammalian) family member. Molecules in 
this family play crucial roles in vascular and trophoblast biology, including the
prevention of apoptosis. In preeclampsia, this process of vascular mimicry is
incomplete, which we theorize hinders the cells interactions with spiral
arterioles. What causes these aberrations? Given what is known from animal models
and human risk factors, reduced placental perfusion and/or certain disease states
(metabolic, immune and cardiovascular) lie upstream. Recent evidence suggests the
surprising conclusion that isolation and culture of cytotrophoblasts from the
placentas of pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia enables normalization of
their gene expression. The affected molecules include SEMA3B, which
down-regulates vascular endothelial growth factor signaling through the PI3K/AKT 
and GSK3 pathways. Thus, some aspects of the aberrant differentiation of
cytotrophoblasts within the uterine wall that is observed in situ may be
reversible. The next challenge is asking what the instigating causes are. There
is added urgency to finding the answers, because these pathways could be valuable
therapeutic targets for reversing abnormal placental function in patients.

BACKGROUND: Gliomas are the most common primary tumors in the central nervous
system. Due to complicated signaling pathways involved in glioma progression,
effective targets for treatment and biomarkers for prognosis prediction are still
scant.
RESULTS: In this study we revealed that a new microRNA (miR), the miR-221, was
highly expressed in the glioma cells, and suppression of miR-221 resulted in
decreased cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion in glioma cells.
Mechanistic experiments validated that miR-221 participates in regulating glioma 
cells proliferation and invasion via suppression of a direct target gene, the
Semaphorin 3B (SEMA3B). The rescue experiment with miR-221 and SEMA3B both
knockdown results in significant reversion of miR-221 induced phenotypes.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings highlight an unappreciated role for
miR-221 and SEMA3B in glioma.

The SEMA3B gene is located in the 3p21.3 LUCA region, which is frequently
affected in different types of cancer. The objective of our study was to expand
our knowledge of the SEMA3B gene as a tumor suppressor and the mechanisms of its 
inactivation. In this study, several experimental approaches were used: tumor
growth analyses and apoptosis assays in vitro and in SCID mice, expression and
methylation assays and other. With the use of the small cell lung cancer cell
line U2020 we confirmed the function of SEMA3B as a tumor suppressor, and showed 
that the suppression can be realized through the induction of apoptosis and,
possibly, associated with the inhibition of angiogenesis. In addition, for the
first time, high methylation frequencies have been observed in both intronic
(32-39%) and promoter (44-52%) CpG-islands in 38 non-small cell lung carcinomas, 
including 16 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 22 adenocarcinomas (ADC), and in 
83 clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC). Correlations between the methylation
frequencies of the promoter and the intronic CpG-islands of SEMA3B with tumor
stage and grade have been revealed for SCC, ADC and ccRCC. The association
between the decrease of the SEMA3B mRNA level and hypermethylation of the
promoter and the intronic CpG-islands has been estimated in renal primary tumors 
(P < 0.01). Using qPCR, we observed on the average 10- and 14-fold decrease of
the SEMA3B mRNA level in SCC and ADC, respectively, and a 4-fold decrease in
ccRCC. The frequency of this effect was high in both lung (92-95%) and renal
(84%) tumor samples. Moreover, we showed a clear difference (P < 0.05) of the
SEMA3B relative mRNA levels in ADC with and without lymph node metastases. We
conclude that aberrant expression and methylation of SEMA3B could be suggested as
markers of lung and renal cancer progression.

Recent evidence suggests that Semaphorin 3B (SEMA3B) is upregulated in severe
preeclampsia, and a major driver of cytotrophoblast aberrations in this disease. 
Here we independently assess whether SEMA3B expression is altered in a large
cohort of severe early onset preeclamptic placentas. We demonstrate that SEMA3B
relative mRNA expression and copy number are not changed in PE placentas. We
confirm this at the protein level by western blot. Interestingly, exposure of
term trophoblasts or explants to hypoxia induced a significant down regulation of
SEMA3B mRNA, but a trend towards increased SEMA3B protein expression. We conclude
that SEMA3B mRNA and protein is not altered in severe early onset preeclamptic
placentas.

BACKGROUND AND PROPOSE: Changes in DNA methylation are associated with changes in
somatic cell fate without the alteration of coding sequences. In addition to its 
use as a traceable biomarker, reversible DNA methylation could also serve as a
therapeutic target. In particular, if the development of drug resistance is
associated with changes in DNA methylation, then demethylation might reverse the 
resistance phenotype. The reversion of the drug-resistance might then be feasible
if the association between abnormal DNA methylation and the development of
drug-resistance could be identified.
METHODS: Methylation differences between the drug-resistance cervical cancer
cell, SiHa, and its derived oxaliplatin-resistant S3 cells were detected by
methylation specific microarray. The drug-resistance cells were treated with
demethylation agent to see if the resistance phenotype were reversed. Targeted
methylation of one of the identified locus in normal cell is expected to
recapitulate the development of resistance and a two-component reporter system is
adopted to monitor the increase of DNA methylation in live cells.
RESULTS: In this report, we identified methylation changes, both genome-wide and 
within individual loci, in the oxaliplatin-resistant cervical cancer cell S3
compared with its parental cell line SiHa. Treatment of S3 with a demethylation
agent reversed increases in methylation and allowed the expression of
methylation-silenced genes. Treatment with the demethylation agent also restored 
the sensitivity of S3 to cisplatin, taxol, and oxaliplatin to the same level as
that of SiHa. Finally, we found that methylation of the target gene Casp8AP2 is
sufficient to increase drug resistance in different cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that global methylation is associated with the
development of drug resistance and could serve as a biomarker and therapeutic
target for drug resistance in cervical cancer.

Dysregulation of the cell proliferation has been implicated in the
pathophysiology of a number of diseases. Cellular senescence limits proliferation
of cancer cells, preventing tumorigenesis and restricting tissue damage. However,
the role of cellular senescence in proliferative nephritis has not been
determined. The proliferative peak in experimental rat nephritis coincided with a
peak in E2A expression in the glomeruli. Meanwhile, E12 (an E2A-encoded
transcription factor) did not promote proliferation of Mesangial cells (MCs) by
itself. We identified caspase-8-binding protein FLICE-associated huge protein
(FLASH) as a novel E2A-binding partner by using a yeast two-hybrid screening.
Knockdown of FLASH suppressed proliferation of MCs. This inhibitory effect was
partially reversed by the knockdown of E2A. In addition, the knockdown of FLASH
induced cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21) expression, but did 
not affect p53 expression. Furthermore, overexpression of E12 and E47 induced
p21, but not p53 in MCs, in the absence of FLASH. We also demonstrated that E2A
and p21 expression at the peak of proliferation was followed by significant
induction of FLASH in mesangial areas in rat proliferative glomerulonephritis.
Moreover, we revealed that FLASH negatively regulates cellular senescence via the
interaction with E12. We also demonstrated that FLASH is involved in the
TNF-α-induced p21 expressions. These results suggest that the functional
interaction of E2A and FLASH play an important role in cell proliferation and

We systematically reviewed the results of the studies on expression regulation,
biological functions, and clinical prognostic significance of CASP8AP2 gene. At
present, the studies showed that the expression of CASP8AP2 gene was regulated by
Homeobox proteins and DNA methylation, and could be silenced by miRNA-210. This
protein was involved in apoptosis mediated by FAS and TNFα, NF-κB activation
mediated by TNFα, regulation of gene expression induced by glucocorticoid and
mineralocorticoid receptor, comprising Cajal body and histone locus body,
transcription of replication-dependent histone, 3' end processing of histone,
regulation of S phase progression, in addition to functioning as coactivator of
transcription factors c-Myb and p73 to activating many genes' expression. On the 
other hand, low expression of CASP8AP2 gene was associated with relapse in
childhood ALL. The deletion of this gene was related to the poor prognosis of
children with T-ALL and T lymphoblastic lymphoma. Furthermore, 3 SNPs in this
gene were possibly correlated with genesis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and
childhood leukemia. In conclusions, CASP8AP2 was a multifunctional protein. It
could function to regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, and gene expression. In
childhood hematological malignancies, CASP8AP2 was a promising molecular marker
with prognostic significance. Some SNPs were possibly correlated with leukemo-
and lymphomogenesis.

OBJECTIVE: To study the methylation level in the promoter of caspase 8 associated
protein 2 (CASP8AP2) gene between samples at diagnosis and in complete remission,
and to investigate its relationship with clinical features and prognosis in
children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
METHODS: Diagnostic DNA samples from 109 newly diagnosed children with ALL
admitted from August 2007 to March 2010, and 94 ALL children in CR (complete
remission) among them were collected. Bisulfite modification and MethyLight
method established by our research team were used to determine the methylation
level of the two key CpG sites (at -1189 and -1176) of the promoter of CASP8AP2
gene.
RESULTS: The average methylation level of the two CpG sites in newly diagnosted
samples was higher than that in CR samples (71.1% ± 1.7% vs 64.2% ± 21.2%) (P =
0.008). Analysis with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that
the area under curve was 0.687 (P = 0.024), indicating that the methylation level
of the two CpG sites was able to predict relapse efficiently to some extent,
76.9% was chosed as a cutoff value to divide the patients into high methylation
group (49 patients) and low methylation group (60 patients). The incidence of
relapse in high methylation group was higher than that in low methylation group
(20.4% vs 6.7%) (P = 0.044), five year relapse free survival in high methylation 
group was also lower than that in low methylation group (Log rank, P = 0.033).
Furthermore, high methylation at new diagnosis were correlated with high level of
minimal residual disease (MRD) before consolidation therapy (P = 0.011). In the
34 children with MRD ≥ 10(-4) at the end of induction remission, the relapse rate
of high methylation patients was significantly higher than that of low
methylation patients (8/16 vs 3/18)(P = 0.038).
CONCLUSION: The abnormal hypermethylation of the two CpG sites (at -1189 and
-1176) of the promoter of the CASP8AP2 gene is possibly associated with
leukemogenesis in childhood ALL. The treatment outcome is more poor in patients
with hypermethylation than that in patients with low methylation. The combination
of the methylation level of the two CpG sites and MRD level at the end induction 
remission is able to predict relapse more effectively.

ARS2 protein is important to early development and cell proliferation, in which
ARS2-CASP8AP2 interaction is implicated. However, the predictive significance of 
ARS2 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is unknown. Here we evaluate
the predictive values of ARS2 expression and combined ARS2 and CASP8AP2
expression in relapse. We showed that ARS2 expression in ALL bone marrow samples 
at initial diagnosis was markedly lower than that in complete remission (CR).
Likewise, the levels of ARS2 expression in the patients suffering from relapse
were significantly lower than that of patients in continuous CR. Furthermore, low
expression of ARS2 was closely correlated to poor treatment response including
poor prednisone response and high minimal residual disease (MRD), and the
patients with high MRD (≥10(-4)) and low ARS2 were more subject to relapse. The
multivariate analyses for relapse free survival and event free survival revealed 
that ARS2 expression remained an independent prognostic factor after adjusting
other risk factors. In addition, combined assessment of ARS2 and CASP8AP2
expression was more accurate to predict relapse, based on which an algorithm
composed of ARS2 and CASP8AP2 expression, prednisone response and MRD (day 78)
was proposed. Together, ARS2 and CASP8AP2 expressions can precisely predict
high-risk of relapse and ALL prognosis.

Nuclear protein, ataxia-telangiectasia locus (NPAT) and FLICE-associated huge
protein (FLASH) are two major components of discrete nuclear structures called
histone locus bodies (HLBs). NPAT is a key co-activator of histone gene
transcription, whereas FLASH through its N-terminal region functions in 3' end
processing of histone primary transcripts. The C-terminal region of FLASH
contains a highly conserved domain that is also present at the end of Yin Yang
1-associated protein-related protein (YARP) and its Drosophila homologue, Mute,
previously shown to localize to HLBs in Drosophila cells. Here, we show that the 
C-terminal domain of human FLASH and YARP interacts with the C-terminal region of
NPAT and that this interaction is essential and sufficient to drive FLASH and
YARP to HLBs in HeLa cells. Strikingly, only the last 16 amino acids of NPAT are 
sufficient for the interaction. We also show that the C-terminal domain of Mute
interacts with a short region at the end of the Drosophila NPAT orthologue, multi
sex combs (Mxc). Altogether, our data indicate that the conserved C-terminal
domain shared by FLASH, YARP, and Mute recognizes the C-terminal sequence of NPAT
orthologues, thus acting as a signal targeting proteins to HLBs. Finally, we
demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of human FLASH can be directly joined with
its N-terminal region through alternative splicing. The resulting 190-amino acid 
MiniFLASH, despite lacking 90% of full-length FLASH, contains all regions
necessary for 3' end processing of histone pre-mRNA in vitro and accumulates in
HLBs.

FLASH/casp8ap2 is indispensable for early embryogenesis but dispensable for
proliferation and differentiation of ES cells.

FLICE/caspase-8-associated huge protein (FLASH)/casp8ap2 is involved in various
cellular functions, such as cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation,
the regulation of apoptosis, and the regulation of histone gene expression. The
down-regulated expression of FLASH has been shown to inhibit cell cycle
progression in the S phase in many kinds of mice and human cell lines and the
inhibition of cell cycle progression may be attributed to the suppressed
expression of replication-dependent histone genes. We here demonstrated that the 
induced knockout of FLASH never affected cell cycle progression in ES cells, in
which the expression of core histone genes was decreased to levels similar to
those in human KB cells sensitive to the knockdown of FLASH. In addition, the
FLASH conditional knockout ES cells could differentiate normally into not only
mesodermal and endodermal cells, but also trophoblasts. In order to investigate
the function of FLASH in early embryogenesis in vivo, we also examined a FLASH
mutant mouse, in which FLASH mutant allele did not express FLASH mRNA in embryos 
and most adult organs, except for the testis. FLASH mutant embryos died between
E3.5 and E8.5. Furthermore, the in vitro cultivation of FLASH mutant embryos
generated by in vitro fertilization showed embryonic lethality at the
pre-implantation stage by inhibiting the hatching of embryos and their adherence 
to substrates. Taken together, these results indicate that FLASH plays an
important role in early embryogenesis, but is not essential for either the
proliferation or differentiation of ES cells.

The pathogenesis of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) is only partly
understood. We analyzed 148 DLBCL by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-chips
to characterize genomic imbalances. Seventy-nine cases were of the germinal
center B-cell like (GCB) type of DLBCL, 49 of the activated B-cell like (ABC)
subtype and 20 were unclassified DLBCL. Twenty-four regions of recurrent genomic 
gains and 38 regions of recurrent genomic losses were identified over the whole
cohort, with a median of 25 imbalances per case for ABC-DLBCL and 19 per case for
GCB-DLBCL. Several recurrent copy number changes showed differential frequencies 
in the GCB- and ABC-DLBCL subgroups, including gains of HDAC7A predominantly in
GCB-DLBCL (38% of cases) and losses of BACH2 and CASP8AP2 predominantly in
ABC-DLBCL (35%), hinting at disparate pathogenetic mechanisms in these entities. 
Correlating gene expression and copy number revealed a strong gene dosage effect 
in all tumors, with 34% of probesets showing a concordant expression change in
affected regions. Two new potential tumor suppressor genes emerging from the
analysis, CASP3 and IL5RA, were sequenced in ten and 16 candidate cases,
respectively. However, no mutations were found, pointing to a potential
haploinsufficiency effect of these genes, considering their reduced expression in
cases with deletions. Our study thus describes differences and similarities in
the landscape of genomic aberrations in the DLBCL subgroups in a large collection
of cases, confirming already known targets, but also discovering novel copy
number changes with possible pathogenetic relevance.

E-cadherin downregulation in cancer cells is associated with
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastatic prowess, but the
underlying mechanisms are incompletely characterized. In this study, we probed
E-cadherin expression at the plasma membrane as a functional assay to identify
genes involved in E-cadherin downregulation. The assay was based on the
E-cadherin-dependent invasion properties of the intracellular pathogen Listeria
monocytogenes. On the basis of a functional readout, automated microscopy and
computer-assisted image analysis were used to screen siRNAs targeting 7,000 human
genes. The validity of the screen was supported by its definition of several
known regulators of E-cadherin expression, including ZEB1, HDAC1, and MMP14. We
identified three new regulators (FLASH, CASP7, and PCGF1), the silencing of which
was sufficient to restore high levels of E-cadherin transcription. In addition,
we identified two new regulators (FBXL5 and CAV2), the silencing of which was
sufficient to increase E-cadherin expression at a posttranscriptional level.
FLASH silencing regulated the expression of E-cadherin and other ZEB1-dependent
genes, through posttranscriptional regulation of ZEB1, but it also regulated the 
expression of numerous ZEB1-independent genes with functions predicted to
contribute to a restoration of the epithelial phenotype. Finally, we also report 
the identification of siRNA duplexes that potently restored the epithelial
phenotype by mimicking the activity of known and putative microRNAs. Our findings
suggest new ways to enforce epithelial phenotypes as a general strategy to treat 
cancer by blocking invasive and metastatic phenotypes associated with EMT.

Whole genome transcriptomic analyses have identified a large number of long
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), many of which are involved in a variety of biological 
functions. However, their functions and molecular mechanisms associated with
prostate cancer (PCa) progression to a virulent and androgen-independent (AI)
form remain elusive. Herein, we investigated the lncRNA expression profiles of
the indolent, androgen-dependent (AD) LNCaP cell line to the aggressive
metastatic, AI C4-2 cell line using microarray technology. The differentially
expressed lncRNAs and genes were identified by microarray technology and the
association in cis or in trans was analyzed to find potential lncRNA target
genes. Expression of candidate lncRNAs and putative targets was evaluated by
real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
The functions of linc00963 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and
invasion were evaluated by a knockdown strategy in vitro using MTT, flow
cytometric analysis and transwell chamber assays. lncRNAs (n=134) were
differentially expressed (FDR<0.001 and fold change≥2) between the LNCaP and C4-2
cell lines. Linc00963 was upregulated most obviously evaluated by qRT-PCR.
Knockdown of linc00963 attenuated C4-2 cell proliferation, motility, invasion
ability, the expression of EGFR and phosphorylation levels of AKT, and promoted
cell apoptosis. Linc00963 was involved in the prostate cancer transition from
androgen-dependent to androgen-independent and metastasis via the EGFR signaling 
pathway.

BACKGROUND: Bone mineral density (BMD) is a heritable phenotype that predicts
fracture risk. We performed fine-mapping by targeted sequencing at WLS, MEF2C,
ARHGAP1/F2 and JAG1 loci prioritized by eQTL and bioinformatic approaches among
56 BMD loci from our previous GWAS meta-analysis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Targeted sequencing was conducted in 1,291 Caucasians from
the Framingham Heart Study (n=925) and Cardiovascular Health Study (n=366),
including 206 women and men with extreme low femoral neck (FN) BMD. A total of
4,964 sequence variants (SNVs) were observed and 80% were rare with MAF <1%. The 
associations between previously identified SNPs in these loci and BMD, while
nominally significant in sequenced participants, were no longer significant after
multiple testing corrections. Conditional analyses did not find protein-coding
variants that may be responsible for GWAS signals. On the other hand, in the
sequenced subjects, we identified novel associations in WLS, ARHGAP1, and 5' of
MEF2C (p-values < 8x10(-5); false discovery rate (FDR) q-values < 0.01) that were
much more strongly associated with BMD compared to the GWAS SNPs. These
associated SNVs are less-common; independent from previous GWAS signals in the
same loci; and located in gene regulatory elements.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that protein-coding variants in selected GWAS
loci did not contribute to GWAS signals. By performing targeted sequencing in
GWAS loci, we identified less-common and rare non-coding SNVs associated with BMD
independently from GWAS common SNPs, suggesting both common and less-common
variants may associate with disease risks and phenotypes in the same loci.

The importance of Notch signaling in colorectal cancer (CRC) carcinogenesis and
progression has previously been presented. Increased expression of Jagged-1
(JAG1), a Notch ligand, in CRC has been revealed, but the detailed prognostic
significance of JAG1 in CRC has not been determined. Protein expression of JAG1
was examined using immunohistochemistry in 158 CRC specimens. Expression of JAG1 
and E-cadherin and their associations with clinicopathologic characteristics,
overall survival (OS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) were evaluated. In vitro
studies using compounds to regulate intracellular signaling and small interfering
RNA to silence JAG1 were performed in a colon cancer cell line. JAG1 expression
in cancerous tissues was weak, moderate, or strong in 32, 36, and 32% of
specimens, respectively, and correlated with histologic type and T stage. In
multivariate analysis, JAG1 expression, histologic type, and lymphatic invasion
independently correlated with OS and RFS. Combination of high JAG1 expression and
low E-cadherin expression had an additive effect toward poorer OS and RFS
compared with the low JAG1/high E-cadherin expression subtype. A significant
correlation between JAG1 expression and KRAS status was detected in groups
stratified as high E-cadherin expression. In vitro studies suggested that
RAS-MEK-MAP kinase and the Wnt pathways positively regulated JAG1 expression.
Gene silencing with siJAG1 indicated that JAG1 promotes the transition from
epithelial to mesenchymal characteristics and cell growth.CONCLUSIONS: High
expression of JAG1 is regulated by various pathways and associated with poor
prognosis through promoting the epithelial to mesenchymal transition and cell
proliferation or maintaining of cell survival in CRC. This article is protected

As circulating monocytes enter the site of disease, the local microenvironment
instructs their differentiation into tissue macrophages (MΦ). To identify
mechanisms that regulate MΦ differentiation, we studied human leprosy as a model,
since M1-type antimicrobial MΦ predominate in lesions in the self-limited form,
whereas M2-type phagocytic MΦ are characteristic of the lesions in the
progressive form. Using a heterotypic co-culture model, we found that
unstimulated endothelial cells (EC) trigger monocytes to become M2 MΦ. However,
biochemical screens identified that IFN-γ and two families of small molecules
activated EC to induce monocytes to differentiate into M1 MΦ. The gene expression
profiles induced in these activated EC, when overlapped with the transcriptomes
of human leprosy lesions, identified Jagged1 (JAG1) as a potential regulator of
MΦ differentiation. JAG1 protein was preferentially expressed in the lesions from
the self-limited form of leprosy, and localized to the vascular endothelium. The 
ability of activated EC to induce M1 MΦ was JAG1-dependent and the addition of
JAG1 to quiescent EC facilitated monocyte differentiation into M1 MΦ with
antimicrobial activity against M. leprae. Our findings indicate a potential role 
for the IFN-γ-JAG1 axis in instructing MΦ differentiation as part of the host
defense response at the site of disease in human leprosy.

The genetic basis is unknown for ∼60% of normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 
(nHH)/Kallmann syndrome (KS). DNAs from (17 male and 31 female) nHH/KS patients
were analyzed by targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of 261 genes involved 
in hypothalamic, pituitary, and/or olfactory pathways, or suggested by chromosome
rearrangements. Selected variants were subjected to Sanger DNA sequencing, the
gold standard. The frequency of Sanger-confirmed variants was determined using
the ExAC database. Variants were classified as likely pathogenic (frameshift,
nonsense, and splice site) or predicted pathogenic (nonsynonymous missense). Two 
novel FGFR1 mutations were identified, as were 18 new candidate genes including: 
AMN1, CCKBR, CRY1, CXCR4, FGF13, GAP43, GLI3, JAG1, NOS1, MASTL, NOTCH1, NRP2,
PALM2, PDE3A, PLEKHA5, RD3, and TRAPPC9, and TSPAN11. Digenic and trigenic
variants were found in 8/48 (16.7%) and 1/48 (2.1%) patients, respectively. NGS
with confirmation by Sanger sequencing resulted in the identification of new
causative FGFR1 gene mutations and suggested 18 new candidate genes in nHH/KS.

Multiple myeloma cell growth relies on intrinsic aggressiveness, due to a high
karyotypic instability, or on the support from bone marrow (BM) niche.We and
other groups have provided evidences that Notch signaling is related to tumor
cell growth, pharmacological resistance, localization/recirculation in the BM and
bone disease.This study indicates that high gene expression levels of Notch
signaling members (JAG1, NOTCH2, HES5 and HES6) correlate with malignant
progression or high-risk disease, and Notch signaling may participate in myeloma 
progression by increasing the BM levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a major player
in myeloma cell growth and survival. Indeed, in vitro results, confirmed by
correlation analysis on gene expression profiles of myeloma patients and
immunohistochemical studies, demonstrated that Notch signaling controls IL-6 gene
expression in those myeloma cells capable of IL-6 autonomous production as well
as in surrounding BM stromal cells. In both cases Notch signaling activation may 
be triggered by myeloma cell-derived Jagged ligands. The evidence that Notch
signaling positively controls IL-6 in the myeloma-associated BM makes this
pathway a key mediator of tumor-directed reprogramming of the bone niche.This
work strengthens the rationale for a novel Notch-directed therapy in multiple
myeloma based on the inhibition of Jagged ligands.

Loss-of-function mutations in the Notch ligand, Jagged1 (Jag1), result in
multi-system developmental pathologies associated with Alagille syndrome (ALGS). 
ALGS patients present with skeletal manifestations including hemi-vertebrae,
reduced bone mass, increased fracture incidence and poor bone healing. However,
it is not known whether the increased fracture risk is due to altered bone
homeostasis (primary) or nutritional malabsorption due to chronic liver disease
(secondary). To determine the significance of Jag1 loss in bone, we characterized
the skeletal phenotype of two Jag1-floxed conditional knockout mouse models:
Prx1-Cre;Jag1(f/f) to target osteoprogenitor cells and their progeny, and
Col2.3-Cre;Jag1(f/f) to target mid-stage osteoblasts and their progeny. Knockout 
phenotypes were compared to wild-type (WT) controls using quantitative
micro-computed tomography, gene expression profiling and mechanical testing.
Expression of Jag1 and the Notch target genes Hes1 and Hey1 was downregulated in 
all Jag1 knockout mice. Osteoblast differentiation genes were downregulated in
whole bone of both groups, but unchanged in Prx1-Cre;Jag1(f/f) cortical bone.
Both knockout lines exhibited changes in femoral trabecular morphology including 
decreased bone volume fraction and increased trabecular spacing, with males
presenting a more severe trabecular osteopenic phenotype. Prx1-Cre;Jag1(f/f) mice
showed an increase in marrow mesenchymal progenitor cell number and,
counterintuitively, developed increased cortical thickness resulting from
periosteal expansion, translating to greater mechanical stiffness and strength.
Similar alterations in femoral morphology were observed in mice with canonical
Notch signaling disrupted using Prx1-Cre-regulatable dominant-negative mastermind
like-protein (dnMAML). Taken together, we report that 1) Jag1 negatively
regulates the marrow osteochondral progenitor pool, 2) Jag1 is required for
normal trabecular bone formation and 3) Notch signaling through homotypic Jag1
signaling in osteochondral progenitors, but not mature osteoblasts, inhibits
periosteal expansion. Therefore, Jag1 signaling within the osteoblast lineage
regulates bone metabolism in a compartment-dependent manner. Moreover, loss of
Jag1 function in osteoblast lineage cells may contribute to the skeletal
phenotype associated with ALGS.

Furan is a significant food contaminant and a potent hepatotoxicant and rodent
liver carcinogen. The carcinogenic effect of furan has been attributed to
genotoxic and non-genotoxic, including epigenetic, changes in the liver; however,
the mechanisms of the furan-induced liver tumorigenicity are still unclear. The
goal of the present study was to investigate the role of transcriptomic and
epigenetic events in the development of hepatic lesions in Fischer (F344) rats
induced by furan treatment in a classic 2-year rodent tumorigenicity bioassay.
High-throughput whole-genome transcriptomic analysis demonstrated distinct
alterations in gene expression in liver lesions induced in male F344 rats treated
with 0.92 or 2.0 mg furan/kg body weight (bw)/day for 104 weeks. Compared to
normal liver tissue, 1336 and 1541 genes were found to be differentially
expressed in liver lesions in rats treated with 0.92 and 2.0 mg furan/kg bw/day, 
respectively, among which 1001 transcripts were differentially expressed at both 
doses. Pairing transcriptomic and next-generation bisulfite sequencing analyses
of the common differentially expressed genes identified 42 CpG island-containing 
genes in which the methylation level was correlated inversely with gene
expression. Forty-eight percent of these genes (20 genes, including Areg, Jag1,
and Foxe1) that exhibited the most significant methylation and gene expression
changes were involved in key pathways associated with different aspects of liver 
pathology. Our findings illustrate that gene-specific DNA methylation changes
have functional consequences and may be an important component of furan
hepatotoxicity and hepatocarcinogenicity.

Chulalongkorn University.

Notch signaling dysregulation plays an important role in altering cancer cell
behaviors; however, its role in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains
controversial. This study aimed to investigate the role of Notch signaling
related genes in human OSCC using a meta-analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus
database (GEO-publicly available gene expression microarray data) and to examine 
the role of Notch signaling in OSCC behaviors. The meta-analysis included 13 GEO 
datasets and was performed by combining effect sizes in a random effect model.
The results demonstrated that in OSCC dysregulated genes participated in the
metabolic process and protein binding as determined by gene ontology analysis.
Enriched pathway analysis demonstrated the majority of the dysregulated genes
were involved in pathway categories as follow; pathway in cancers, small cell
lung cancer, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and cell 
cycle progression. Interestingly, the enriched pathway analysis also demonstrated
that OSCC samples exhibited an upregulation of genes in Notch signaling pathway, 
namely JAG1, JAG2, ADAM17, NCSTN, PSEN1, NCOR2, NUMB, DVL3, HDAC1, and HDAC2.
Furthermore, Notch signaling inhibition by a γ-secretase inhibitor significantly 
decreased OSCC cell proliferation in vitro, corresponding with a decrease in
C-FOS mRNA expression. The study demonstrated that Notch signaling is
dysregulated in human OSCC and plays a role in cell proliferation. (J Oral Sci
58, 283-294, 2016).

Aldehyde dehydrogenases participate in a variety of cellular homeostatic
mechanisms like metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, whereas
recently, they have been implicated in normal and cancer cell stemness. We
explored roles for ALDH3A1 in conferring resistance to
chemotherapeutics/radiation/oxidative stress and whether ectopic overexpression
of ALDH3A1 could lead to alterations of gene expression profile associated with
cancer stem cell-like phenotype. MCF-7 cells were stably transfected either with 
an empty vector (mock) or human aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 cDNA. The expression
of aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 in MCF-7 cells was associated with altered cell
proliferation rate and enhanced cell resistance against various chemotherapeutic 
drugs (4-hydroxyperoxycyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, and
5-fluorouracil). Aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 expression also led to increased
tolerance of MCF-7 cells to gamma radiation and hydrogen peroxide-induced stress.
Furthermore, aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1-expressing MCF-7 cells exhibited gene
up-regulation of cyclins A, B1, B2, and down-regulation of cyclin D1 as well as
transcription factors p21, CXR4, Notch1, SOX2, SOX4, OCT4, and JAG1. When
compared to mock cells, no changes were observed in mRNA levels of ABCA2 and
ABCB1 protein pumps with only a minor decrease of the ABCG2 pump in the aldehyde 
dehydrogenase 3A1-expressing cells. Also, the adhesion molecules EpCAM and CD49F 
were also found to be up-regulated in aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1expressing cells.
Taken together, ALDH3A1 confers a multi-modality resistance phenotype in MCF-7
cells associated with slower growth rate, increased clonogenic capacity, and
altered gene expression profile, underlining its significance in cell
homeostasis.

OBJECTIVE: To make genetic diagnosis of Alagille syndrome (ALGS) patients using
target gene sequence capture and next generation sequencing technology.
METHOD: Target gene sequence capture and next generation sequencing were used to 
detect ALGS gene of 4 patients. They were hospitalized at the Affiliated
Hospital, Capital Institute of Pediatrics between January 2014 and December 2015,
referred to clinical diagnosis of ALGS typical and atypical respectively in 2
cases. Blood samples were collected from patients and their parents and genomic
DNA was extracted from lymphocytes. Target gene sequence capture and next
generation sequencing was detected. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the
results of the patients and their parents.
RESULT: Cholestasis, heart defects, inverted triangular face and butterfly
vertebrae were presented as main clinical features in 4 male patients. The first 
hospital visiting ages ranged from 3 months and 14 days to 3 years and 1 month.
The age of onset ranged from 3 days to 42 days (median 23 days). According to the
clinical diagnostic criteria of ALGS, patient 1 and patient 2 were considered as 
typical ALGS. The other 2 patients were considered as atypical ALGS. Four Jagged 
1(JAG1) pathogenic mutations were detected. Three different missense mutations
were detected in patient 1 to patient 3 with ALGS(c.839C>T(p.W280X), c.
703G>A(p.R235X), c. 1720C>T(p.V574M)). The JAG1 mutation of patient 3 was first
reported. Patient 4 had one novel insertion mutation
(c.1779_1780insA(p.Ile594AsnfsTer23)). Parental analysis verified that the JAG1
missense mutation of 3 patients were de novo. The results of sanger sequencing
was consistent with the results of the next generation sequencing.
CONCLUSION: Target gene sequence capture combined with next generation sequencing
can detect two pathogenic genes in ALGS and test genes of other related diseases 
in infantile cholestatic diseases simultaneously and presents a high throughput, 
high efficiency and low cost. It may provide molecular diagnosis and treatment
for clinicians with good clinical application prospects.

BACKGROUND: The Synapsins (SYN1, SYN2, and SYN3) are important players in the
adult brain, given their involvement in synaptic transmission and plasticity, as 
well as in the developing brain through roles in axon outgrowth and
synaptogenesis. We and others previously reported gene expression dysregulation, 
both as increases and decreases, of Synapsins in mood disorders, but little is
known about the regulatory mechanisms leading to these differences. Thus, we
proposed to study DNA methylation at theses genes' promoter regions, under the
assumption that altered epigenetic marks at key regulatory sites would be the
cause of gene expression changes and thus part of the mood disorder etiology.
METHODS: We performed CpG methylation mapping focusing on the three genes'
predicted CpG islands using the Sequenom EpiTYPER platform. DNA extracted from
post-mortem brain tissue (BA10) from individuals who had lived with bipolar
disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), as well as psychiatrically
healthy individuals was used. Differences in methylation across all CpGs within a
CpG island and between the three diagnostic groups were assessed by 2-way mixed
model analyses of variance.
RESULTS: We found no significant results for SYN1 or SYN3, but there was a
significant group difference in SYN2 methylation, as well as an overall pattern
of hypomethylation across the CpG island. Furthermore, we found a significant
inverse correlation of DNA methylation with SYN2a mRNA expression.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings contribute to previous work showing dysregulation of 
Synapsins, particularly SYN2, in mood disorders and improve our understanding of 
the regulatory mechanisms that precipitate these changes likely leading to the BD
or MDD phenotype.

Brain in situ hybridization maps as a source for reverse-engineering

Microarray data have been a valuable resource for identifying transcriptional
regulatory relationships among genes. As an example, brain region-specific
transcriptional regulatory events have the potential of providing etiological
insights into Alzheimer Disease (AD). However, there is often a paucity of
suitable brain-region specific expression data obtained via microarrays or other 
high throughput means. The Allen Brain Atlas in situ hybridization (ISH) data
sets (Jones et al., 2009) represent a potentially valuable alternative source of 
high-throughput brain region-specific gene expression data for such purposes. In 
this study, Allen Brain Atlas mouse ISH data in the hippocampal fields were
extracted, focusing on 508 genes relevant to neurodegeneration. Transcriptional
regulatory networks were learned using three high-performing network inference
algorithms. Only 17% of regulatory edges from a network reverse-engineered based 
on brain region-specific ISH data were also found in a network constructed upon
gene expression correlations in mouse whole brain microarrays, thus showing the
specificity of gene expression within brain sub-regions. Furthermore, the ISH
data-based networks were used to identify instructive transcriptional regulatory 
relationships. Ncor2, Sp3 and Usf2 form a unique three-party regulatory motif,
potentially affecting memory formation pathways. Nfe2l1, Egr1 and Usf2 emerge
among regulators of genes involved in AD (e.g. Dhcr24, Aplp2, Tia1, Pdrx1, Vdac1,
and Syn2). Further, Nfe2l1, Egr1 and Usf2 are sensitive to dietary factors and
could be among links between dietary influences and genes in the AD etiology.
Thus, this approach of harnessing brain region-specific ISH data represents a
rare opportunity for gleaning unique etiological insights for diseases such as
AD.

The epigenome is thought to mediate between genes and the environment,
particularly in response to adverse life experiences. Similar to other
psychiatric diseases, the suicide liability of an individual appears to be
influenced by many genetic factors of small effect size as well as by
environmental stressors. To identify epigenetic marks associated with suicide,
which is considered the endpoint of complex gene-environment interactions, we
compared the cortex DNA methylation patterns of 6 suicide completers versus 6
non-psychiatric sudden-death controls, using Illumina 450K methylation arrays.
Consistent with a multifactorial disease model, we found DNA methylation changes 
in a large number of genes, but no changes with large effects reaching
genome-wide significance. Global methylation of all analyzed CpG sites was
significantly (0.25 percentage point) lower in suicide than in control brains,
whereas the vast majority (97%) of the top 1,000 differentially methylated
regions (DMRs) were higher methylated (0.6 percentage point) in suicide brains.
Annotation analysis of the top 1,000 DMRs revealed an enrichment of
differentially methylated promoters in functional categories associated with
transcription and expression in the brain. In addition, we performed a
comprehensive literature research to identify suicide genes that have been
replicated in independent genetic association, brain methylation and/or
expression studies. Although, in general, there was no significant overlap
between different published data sets or between our top 1,000 DMRs and published
data sets, our methylation screen strengthens a number of candidate genes (APLP2,
BDNF, HTR1A, NUAK1, PHACTR3, MSMP, SLC6A4, SYN2, and SYNE2) and supports a role
for epigenetics in the pathophysiology of suicide.

Neuroinflammation can damage the brain and plays a critical role in the
pathophysiology of epilepsy. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 4 (TIMP4) is
an inflammation-induced apoptosis and matrix turnover factor involved in several 
neuronal disorders and inflammatory diseases. Evidence has shown linkage
disequilibrium between rs3755724 (-55C/T) of this gene with synapsin 2 (SYN2)
rs3773364 and peroxisome proliferator-activated G receptor (PPARG) rs2920502
loci, which contribute to epilepsy in Caucasians. The aim of this study was to
examine the association of these loci alone or their haplotypes with the risk of 
epilepsy in the Malaysian population. Genomic DNA of 1241 Malaysian Chinese,
Indian, and Malay subjects (670 patients with epilepsy and 571 healthy
individuals) was genotyped for the candidate loci by using the Sequenom MassArray
method. Allele and genotype association of rs3755724 with susceptibility to
epilepsy was significant in the Malaysian Chinese with focal epilepsy under
codominant and dominant models (C vs. T: 1.5 (1.1-2.0), p=0.02; CT vs. TT: 1.8
(1.2-2.8), p=0.007 and 1.8 (1.2-2.7), p=0.006, respectively). The T allele and
the TT genotype were more common in patients than in controls. No significant
association was found between rs2920502 and rs3773364-rs3755724-rs2920502
haplotypes for susceptibility to epilepsy in each ethnicity. This study provides 
evidence that the promoter TIMP4 rs3755724 is a new focal epilepsy susceptibility
variant that is plausibly involved in inflammation-induced seizures in Malaysian 
Chinese.

Both the molecular co-chaperone FKBP51 and the presynaptic vesicle protein
synapsin (alternatively spliced from SYN1-3) are intensively discussed players in
the still insufficiently explored pathobiology of psychiatric disorders such as
major depression, schizophrenia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To
address their still unknown interaction, we compared the expression levels of
synapsin and five other neurostructural and HPA axis related marker proteins in
the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus of restrained-stressed and
unstressed Fkbp5 knockout mice and corresponding wild-type littermates. In
addition, we compared and correlated the gene expression levels of SYN1, SYN2 and
FKBP5 in three different online datasets comprising expression data of human
healthy subjects as well as of predominantly medicated patients with different
psychiatric disorders. In summary, we found that Fkbp5 deletion, which we
previously demonstrated to improve stress-coping behavior in mice, prevents the
stress-induced decline in prefrontal cortical (pc), but not in hippocampal
synapsin expression. Accordingly, pc, but not hippocampal, synapsin protein
levels correlated positively with a more active mouse stress coping behavior.
Searching for an underlying mechanism, we found evidence that deletion of Fkbp5
might prevent stress-induced pc synapsin loss, at least in part, through
improvement of pc Akt kinase activity. These results, together with our finding
that FKBP5 and SYN1 mRNA levels were regulated in opposite directions in the PFC 
of schizophrenic patients, who are known for exhibiting an altered stress-coping 
behavior, provide the first evidence of a role for pc synapsin in FKBP51
modulation of stress responsiveness. This role might extend to other tissues, as 
we found FKBP5 and SYN1 levels to correlate inversely not only in human PFC
samples but also in other expression sites. The main limitation of this study is 
the small number of individuals included in the correlation analyses. Future
studies will have to verify the here-postulated role of the FKBP51-Akt
kinase-synapsin pathway in stress responsiveness.

OBJECTIVES: Venlafaxine (VLX), a serotonine-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, is 
one of the most commonly used antidepressant drugs in clinical practice for the
treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Despite being more potent than its 
predecessors, similarly to them, the therapeutical effect of VLX is visible only 
3-4 weeks after the beginning of treatment. Furthermore, recent papers show that 
antidepressants, including also VLX, enhance the motor recovery after stroke even
in non depressed persons. In the present, transcriptomic-based study we looked
for changes in gene expressions after a long-term VLX administration.
METHODS: Osmotic minipumps were implanted subcutaneously into Dark Agouti rats
providing a continuous (40 mg/kg/day) VLX delivery for three weeks. Frontal
regions of the cerebral cortex were isolated and analyzed using Illumina bead
arrays to detect genes showing significant chances in expression. Gene set
enrichment analysis was performed to identify specific regulatory networks
significantly affected by long term VLX treatment.
RESULTS: Chronic VLX administration may have an effect on neurotransmitter
release via the regulation of genes involved in vesicular exocytosis and receptor
endocytosis (such as Kif proteins, Myo5a, Sv2b, Syn2 or Synj2). Simultaneously,
VLX activated the expression of genes involved in neurotrophic signaling (Ntrk2, 
Ntrk3), glutamatergic transmission (Gria3, Grin2b and Grin2a), neuroplasticity
(Camk2g/b, Cd47), synaptogenesis (Epha5a, Gad2) and cognitive processes (Clstn2).
Interestingly, VLX increased the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial
antioxidant activity (Bcl2 and Prdx1). Additionally, VLX administration also
modulated genes related to insulin signaling pathway (Negr1, Ppp3r1, Slc2a4 and
Enpp1), a mechanism that has recently been linked to neuroprotection, learning
and memory.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest that chronic VLX treatment improves
functional reorganization and brain plasticity by influencing gene expression in 
regulatory networks of motor cortical areas. These results are consonant with the
synaptic (network) hypothesis of depression and antidepressant-induced motor
recovery after stroke.

Regulated promoters are an important basic genetic tool allowing, for example,
gene-dosage and gene depletion studies. We have previously described a
cumate-inducible promoter (P(Q5)) that is functional in diverse
Alphaproteobacteria. This promoter has been engineered by combining a synthetic
minimal promoter, P(syn2), and operator sites and the repressor of the
Pseudomonas putida F1 cym/cmt system. In the present study, we engineered a
vanillate-regulated promoter using P(syn2) and the regulatory elements of the
Caulobacter crescentus vanR-vanAB system. We show that the resulting promoter,
which we called P(V10), responds rapidly to the inducer vanillate with an
induction ratio of about two orders of magnitude in Sphingomonas melonis Fr1. In 
contrast to the switch-like behavior of P(Q5), P(V10) shows a linear
dose-response curve at intermediate vanillate concentrations, allowing graded
gene expression. P(V10) is functionally compatible with and independent of P(Q5) 
and cumate, and vice versa, suggesting that both systems can be used
simultaneously.

α-kleisins are core components of meiotic and mitotic cohesin complexes.
Arabidopsis contains genes encoding four α-kleisins. SYN1, a REC8 ortholog, is
essential for meiosis, while SYN2 and SYN4 appear to be SCC1 orthologs and
function in mitosis. SYN3 is enriched in the nucleolus of meiotic and mitotic
cells and is essential for megagametogenesis. It was recently shown that
expression of SYN3-RNAi constructs in buds cause changes in meiotic gene
expression that result in meiotic alterations. In this report we show that
expression of SYN3 from the 35S promoter with either a c-terminal Myc or FAST tag
causes a reduction in SYN1 mRNA levels that results in alterations in sister
chromatid cohesion, homologous chromosome synapsis and synaptonemal complex
formation during both male and female meiosis.

Altered brain protein expression profiles are associated with molecular
neurological dysfunction in the PKU mouse model.

Phenylketonuria (PKU), if not detected and treated in newborns, causes severe
neurological dysfunction and cognitive and behavioral deficiencies. Despite the
biochemical characterization of PKU, the molecular mechanisms underlying
PKU-associated brain dysfunction remain poorly understood. The aim of this study 
was to gain insights into the pathogenesis of this neurological damage by
analyzing protein expression profiles in brain tissue of Black and Tan
BRachyury-PahEnu2 mice (a mouse model of PKU). We compared the cerebral protein
expression of homozygous PKU mice with that of their heterozygous counterparts
using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis analysis, and identified 21 
differentially expressed proteins, four of which were over-expressed and 17
under-expressed. An in silico bioinformatic approach indicated that protein
under-expression was related to neuronal differentiation and dendritic growth,
and to such neurological disorders as progressive motor neuropathy and movement
disorders. Moreover, functional annotation analyses showed that some identified
proteins were involved in oxidative metabolism. To further investigate the
proteins involved in the neurological damage, we validated two of the proteins
that were most strikingly under-expressed, namely, Syn2 and Dpysl2, which are
involved in synaptic function and neurotransmission. We found that Glu2/3 and NR1
receptor subunits were over-expressed in PKU mouse brain. Our results indicate
that differential expression of these proteins may be associated with the
processes underlying PKU brain dysfunction, namely, decreased synaptic plasticity
and impaired neurotransmission. We identified a set of proteins whose expression 
is affected by hyperphenylalaninemia. We think that phenylketonuria (PKU) brain
dysfunction also depends on reduced Syn2 and Dpysl2 levels, increased Glu2/3 and 
NR1 levels, and decreased Pkm, Ckb, Pgam1 and Eno1 levels. These findings finally
confirm that alteration in synaptic function, in transmission and in energy
metabolism underlie brain damage provoked by hyperphenylalaninemias.

Author information: 
(1)Translational Neuropsychiatry Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus
University, Risskov, Denmark.

OBJECTIVE: This study systematically investigated the effect of chronic mild
stress and response to antidepressant treatment in the lateral habenula at the
whole genome level.
METHODS: Rat whole genome expression chips (Affymetrix) were used to detect gene 
expression regulations in the lateral habenula of rats subjected to chronic mild 
stress (mild stressors exchanged twice a day for 8 weeks). Some rats received
antidepressant treatment during fifth to eights week of CMS. The lateral habenula
gene expression profile was studied through the gene ontology and signal pathway 
analyses using bioinformatics. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) was used to verify the microarray results and determine the expression
of the Fcrla, Eif3k, Sec3l1, Ubr5, Abca8a, Ankrd49, Cyp2j10, Frs3, Syn2, and
Znf503 genes in the lateral habenula tissue.
RESULTS: In particular we found that stress and antidepressant treatment affected
intracellular cascades like growth factor receptor signaling, G-protein-coupled
receptor signaling, and Wnt signaling - processes involved in the neuroplastic
changes observed during the progression of depression and antidepressant
treatment.
CONCLUSION: The present study suggests an important role of the lateral habenula 
in the development of depression-like conditions and correlates to previous
studies demonstrating a significant role of the lateral habenula in
depressive-like conditions and antidepressant treatment.

Neuroinflammation is emerging as an important pathway involved in Parkinson's
disease (PD) pathogenesis. Herein, we investigated the effect of 4 top
PD-associated genetic variants in Caucasians listed on the top risk loci
identified by meta-analysis of genome wide-association studies in PDGene database
(http://www.pdgene.org/top_results), including serine threonine kinase 39 (STK39)
rs1955337, bone marrow stromal cell antigen 1 (BST1) rs11724635, major
histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 1 (HLA-DQB1) rs9275326, and signal 
peptide peptidase-like 2B (SPPL2B) rs62120679, by genotyping 596 Han-Chinese
patients with PD and 597 age-matched control subjects. Compared with subjects
with STK39 rs1955337 GG genotype, those with TT genotype had a 1.64-fold
increased risk of PD (95% confidence interval: 1.13-2.39, P = 0.010). The
recessive model also demonstrated an increased PD risk in TT genotype (odds
ratio: 1.59, 95% confidence interval: 1.12-2.27) compared with the other
genotypes (GT + GG). PD patients demonstrate a similar genotypic and allelic
frequency in BST1 rs11724635, HLA-DQB1 rs9275326, and SPPL2B rs62120679 compared 
with controls. These findings suggested that the STK39 rs1955337 TT genotype is a
risk factor for Han-Chinese patients with PD in Taiwan. The ethnic discrepancies 
of the other 3 genetic variants may indicate a distinct genetic background of
neuroinflammation between PD patients in Han-Chinese and Caucasians.

Signal peptide peptidase (SPP) and the homologous SPP-like (SPPL) proteases
SPPL2a, SPPL2b, SPPL2c and SPPL3 belong to the family of GxGD intramembrane
proteases. SPP/SPPLs selectively cleave transmembrane domains in type II
orientation and do not require additional co-factors for proteolytic activity.
Orthologues of SPP and SPPLs have been identified in other vertebrates, plants,
and eukaryotes. In line with their diverse subcellular localisations ranging from
the ER (SPP, SPPL2c), the Golgi (SPPL3), the plasma membrane (SPPL2b) to
lysosomes/late endosomes (SPPL2a), the different members of the SPP/SPPL family
seem to exhibit distinct functions. Here, we review the substrates of these
proteases identified to date as well as the current state of knowledge about the 
physiological implications of these proteolytic events as deduced from in vivo
studies. Furthermore, the present knowledge on the structure of intramembrane
proteases of the SPP/SPPL family, their cleavage mechanism and their substrate
requirements are summarised. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled:
Intramembrane Proteases.

(SPPL3).

Signal peptide peptidase (SPP), its homologs, the SPP-like proteases SPPL2a/b/c
and SPPL3, as well as presenilin, the catalytic subunit of the γ-secretase
complex, are intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl proteases of the GxGD type. In this 
study, we identified the 18-kDa leader peptide (LP18) of the foamy virus envelope
protein (FVenv) as a new substrate for intramembrane proteolysis by human SPPL3
and SPPL2a/b. In contrast to SPPL2a/b and γ-secretase, which require substrates
with an ectodomain shorter than 60 amino acids for efficient intramembrane
proteolysis, SPPL3 cleaves mutant FVenv lacking the proprotein convertase
cleavage site necessary for the prior shedding. Moreover, the cleavage product of
FVenv generated by SPPL3 serves as a new substrate for consecutive intramembrane 
cleavage by SPPL2a/b. Thus, human SPPL3 is the first GxGD-type aspartyl protease 
shown to be capable of acting like a sheddase, similar to members of the rhomboid
family, which belong to the class of intramembrane-cleaving serine proteases.

Intramembrane proteolytic cleavage by human signal peptide peptidase like 3 and
malaria signal peptide peptidase.

Signal peptide peptidase (SPP) is an intramembrane cleaving protease (I-CLiP)
identified by its cleavage of several type II membrane signal peptides. To date, 
only human SPP has been directly shown to have proteolytic activity. Here we
demonstrate that the most closely related human homologue of SPP, signal peptide 
peptidase like 3 (SPPL3), cleaves a SPP substrate, but a more distantly related
homologue, signal peptide peptidase like 2b (SPPL2b), does not. These data
provide strong evidence that the SPP and SPPL3 have conserved active sites and
suggest that the active sites SPPL2b is distinct. We have also synthesized a cDNA
designed to express the single SPP gene present in Plasmodium falciparum and
cloned this into a mammalian expression vector. When the malaria SPP protein is
expressed in mammalian cells it cleaves a SPP substrate. Notably, several human
SPP inhibitors block the proteolytic activity of malarial SPP (mSPP). Studies
from several model organisms that express multiple SPP homologs demonstrate that 
the silencing of a single SPP homologue is lethal. Based on these data, we
hypothesize that mSPP is a potential a novel therapeutic target for malaria.

Differential localization and identification of a critical aspartate suggest
non-redundant proteolytic functions of the presenilin homologues SPPL2b and
SPPL3.

Signal peptide peptidase (SPP) is an unusual aspartyl protease that mediates
clearance of signal peptides by proteolysis within the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER). Like presenilins, which provide the proteolytically active subunit of the
gamma-secretase complex, SPP contains a critical GXGD motif in its C-terminal
catalytic center. Although SPP is known to be an aspartyl protease of the GXGD
type, several presenilin homologues/SPP-like proteins (PSHs/SPPL) of unknown
function have been identified by data base searches. We now investigated the
subcellular localization and a putative proteolytic activity of PSHs/SPPLs in
cultured cells and in an in vivo model. We demonstrate that SPPL2b is targeted
through the secretory pathway to endosomes/lysosomes, whereas SPP and SPPL3 are
restricted to the ER. As suggested by the differential subcellular localization
of SPPL2b compared with SPP and SPPL3, we found distinct phenotypes upon
antisense gripNA-mediated knockdown in zebrafish. spp and sppl3 knockdowns in
zebrafish result in cell death within the central nervous system, whereas
reduction of sppl2b expression causes erythrocyte accumulation in an enlarged
caudal vein. Moreover, expression of D/A mutations of the putative C-terminal
active sites of spp, sppl2, and sppl3 produced phenocopies of the respective
knockdown phenotypes. Thus, our data suggest that all investigated PSHs/SPPLs are
members of the novel family of GXGD aspartyl proteases. Furthermore, SPPL2b is
shown to be the first member of the SPP/PSH/SPPL family that is not located
within the ER but in endosomal/lysosomal vesicles.

A wide variety of biological effects are induced in cells that are exposed to
ionizing radiation. The expression changes of coding mRNA and non-coding
micro-RNA have been implicated in irradiated cells. The involvement of other
classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), such as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), long 
ncRNAs (lncRNAs), and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in cells recovering from
radiation-induced damage has not been examined. Thus, we investigated whether
these ncRNA were undergoing changes in cells exposed to ionizing radiation. The
modulation of ncRNAs expression was determined in human TK6 (p53 positive) and
WTK1 (p53 negative) cells. The snoRNA host genes SNHG1, SNHG6, and SNHG11 were
induced in TK6 cells. In WTK1 cells, SNHG1 was induced but SNHG6, and SNHG11 were
repressed. SNHG7 was repressed in TK6 cells and was upregulated in WTK1 cells.
The lncRNA MALAT1 and SOX2OT were induced in both TK6 and WTK1 cells and SRA1 was
induced in TK6 cells only. Interestingly, the MIAT and PIWIL1 were not expressed 
in TK6 cells before or after the ionizing radiation treatment. The MIAT and
PIWIL1 were upregulated in WTK1 cells. This data provides evidence that altered
ncRNA expression is a part of the complex stress response operating in
radiation-treated cells and this response depends on functional p53.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although hepatitis B virus (HBV) integration into the human
genome has been considered as one of the major causative factors to
hepatocarcinogenesis, the underlying mechanism(s) was still elusive. Here we
investigate the essential difference(s) of HBV integration between HCC tumor and 
adjacent non-tumor tissues and explore the factor(s) that determine the
oncogenicity of HBV integration.
METHODS: 1115 HBV integration sites were collected from four recent studies.
Functional annotation analysis of integration targeted host genes (ITGs) was
performed using DAVID based on Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway databases.
Array-based expression profiles, real-time qPCR and western blot were used to
detect the expression of recurrent integration targeted genes (RTGs). The
biological consequences of the overexpression of UBXN8 in 8 HCC cell lines were
studied in vitro.
RESULTS: HBV is prone to integrate in genic regions (exons, introns, and
promoters) and gene-dense regions. Functional annotation analysis reveals that,
compared to those in adjacent non-tumor tissues, ITGs in HCC tumor tissues were
significantly enriched in functional terms related to negative regulation of cell
death, transcription regulation, development and differentiation, and cancer
related pathways. 32% of the 75 RTGs identified in this analysis expressed
abnormally in HCC tissues. UBXN8, one of the RTGs, was identified as a new tumor 
suppressor candidate which functions in a TP53 dependent manner.
CONCLUSIONS: The oncogenicity of HBV integration was determined, to some extend
by the function of HBV integration targeted host genes in HCC.

A mouse homologue of the human Rep-8 gene was cloned by PCR methods using
degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to highly conserved regions
between human and mouse genes, and by the Marathon-Ready cDNA amplification
method. The full-length mouse Rep-8 contains 1422 nucleotides and codes for a
protein of 277 amino acids with a calculated mol. wt. of 31,519. The overall
amino acid sequence homology between mouse and human Rep-8 proteins was 73%, and 
the overall nucleic acid sequence similarity was 65%. The predicted amino acid
sequence of mouse Rep-8 has leucine zipper-like motifs in the N-terminal region, 
similar to the human Rep-8 protein. Rep-8 exists as a single-copy gene and is
expressed in both the early and late embryonic stages of mouse development,
suggesting that the Rep-8 gene product has an important role in embryogenesis.
The genomic structure of the mouse Rep-8 gene was characterized extensively so
that a gene targeting strategy could be used to develop an understanding of the
biological function(s) of this interesting gene and its product.

A novel human gene referred to as the Rep-8 gene (D8S2298E) was cloned by a
combination of exon trapping, thermal asymmetric interlaced-PCR, and screening of
a cDNA library. It is located in human chromosome 8p11.2-p12. The gene consists
of eight exons and spans about 20 kb between the glutathione S-reductase and the 
protein phosphatase 2A beta subunit genes. The full-length Rep-8 gene contains
1483 nucleotides and codes for a protein of 270 amino acids. Southern blot
experiments showed that the Rep-8 gene exists as a single copy per haploid. With 
a zoo blot analysis, human Rep-8 DNA hybridized strongly with the monkey DNA, but
only weakly with the DNAs of species other than Homo sapiens. Northern blot
analysis showed that it is expressed abundantly in the testis and ovary,
suggesting that the Rep-8 gene product may play a role in reproduction.

The worst subtype of neuroblastoma is caused by MYCN oncogene amplification and
N-Myc oncoprotein over-expression. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as 
critical regulators of gene expression and tumourigenesis. While Myc oncoproteins
are well-known to exert tumourigenic effects by regulating the expression of
protein-coding genes and microRNAs, little is known about which lncRNAs are Myc
targets and whether the Myc target lncRNAs play a role in Myc-induced
oncogenesis. Here we performed differential gene expression studies using lncRNA 
microarray in neuroblastoma cells after transfection with control or
N-Myc-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), and identified N-Myc target lncRNAs
including the novel lncRNA linc00467, the expression and function of which were
completely unknown. RT-PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays
showed that N-Myc suppressed linc00467 gene expression through direct binding to 
the linc00467 gene promoter and reducing linc00467 promoter activity. While N-Myc
suppressed the expression of RD3, the protein-coding gene immediately down-stream
of linc00467 gene, through direct binding to the RD3 gene promoter and reducing
RD3 promoter activity, linc00467 reduced RD3 mRNA expression. Moreover,
Affymetrix microarray analysis revealed that one of genes significantly
up-regulated by linc00467 siRNA was the tumour suppressor gene DKK1. Importantly,
knocking-down linc00467 expression with siRNA in neuroblastoma cells reduced the 
number of viable cells and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells, and
co-transfection with DKK1 siRNA blocked the effects. These findings therefore
demonstrate that N-Myc-mediated suppression of linc00467 gene transcription
counterintuitively blocks N-Myc-mediated reduction in RD3 mRNA expression, and
reduces neuroblastoma cell survival by inducing DKK1 expression.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related
mortality worldwide. Despite progress in diagnostics and treatment of HCC, its
prognosis remains poor. Emerging studies showed that long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNAs) have crucial regulatory roles in cancer biology. In the current study, 
differentially expressed lncRNAs between HCC and paired non-tumor tissues were
identified using microarrays. The effects of a specific differentially expressed 
lncRNA (termed ZEB1-AS1) on tumor progression were investigated in vitro and in
vivo. We found that ZEB1-AS1 is frequently upregulated in HCC samples, especially
in metastatic tumor tissues. DNA methylation analysis shows a tumor-specific
ZEB1-AS1 promoter hypomethylation. Aberrant methylation is tightly correlated
with overexpression of ZEB1-AS1 in HCC. Patients with ZEB1-AS1 hypomethylation or
with high ZEB1-AS1 expression have poor recurrence-free survival. Functionally,
ZEB1-AS1 promotes tumor growth and metastasis, acts as an oncogene in HCC. The
ZEB1-AS1 gene is located in physical contiguity with ZEB1 and positively
regulates the ZEB1 expression. ZEB1 inhibition partially abrogates
ZEB1-AS1-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer
metastasis. Our results provide novel insights into the function of lncRNA-driven
hepatocarcinogenesis, highlight the important role of ZEB1-AS1 and ZEB1 in HCC
progression, and indicate that ZEB1-AS1 may be served as a valuable prognostic
biomarker for HCC.

BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a stress-sensitive disorder.
Environmental factors including stress can trigger epigenetic changes, which have
not been well-studied in IBS. We performed a pilot study investigating
genome-wide DNA methylation of IBS patients and healthy controls (HCs) to
identify potential epigenetic markers and associated pathways. Additionally, we
investigated relationships of epigenetic changes in selected genes with clinical 
traits.
METHODS: Twenty-seven IBS patients (59% women; 10 IBS-diarrhea, 8
IBS-constipation, 9 IBS-mixed) and 23 age- and sex-matched HCs were examined. DNA
methylation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was measured using
HM450 BeadChip, and representative methylation differences were confirmed by
bisulphite sequencing. Gene expression was measured using quantitative PCR.
Gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI symptoms were measured using validated
questionnaires. Associations were tested using non-parametric methods.
KEY RESULTS: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of IBS patients compared with 
HCs identified 133 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) (mean difference
≥10%; p < 0.05). These genes were associated with gene ontology terms including
glutathione metabolism related to oxidative stress and neuropeptide hormone
activity. Validation by sequencing confirmed differential methylation of
subcommissural organ (SCO)-Spondin (SSPO), glutathione-S-transferases mu 5
(GSTM5), and tubulin polymerization promoting protein genes. Methylation of two
promoter CpGs in GSTM5 was associated with epigenetic silencing. Epigenetic
changes in SSPO gene were positively correlated with hospital anxiety and
depression scores in IBS patients (r > 0.4 and false discovery rate <0.05).
CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: This study is the first to comprehensively explore the 
methylome of IBS patients. We identified DMPs in novel candidate genes which
could provide new insights into disease mechanisms; however, these preliminary
findings warrant confirmation in larger, independent studies.

Microbial control of the cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.) by
Egyptian Bacillus thuringiensis isolates.

Alfazairy AA(1), El-Ahwany AM, Mohamed EA, Zaghloul HA, El-Helow ER.

Author information:

Four local Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) isolates that had been serologically
identified as Bt var. kurstaki (Btk2, Btk3, and Btk66) and Bt var. mexicanensis
(Btm27), in addition to two reference strains (4D20 and 4AC1), were laboratory
assayed as microbial control agents against the Egyptian cotton leafworm
Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification
analysis revealed that each of the six experimental strains carries, at least, a 
cry1 type gene which expresses a protein toxin active against lepidopterous
insects. Additionally, PCR amplification results demonstrated that 4D20 and Btk66
contain the Lepidoptera- and Diptera-active cry2 type gene and that Btk66
contains Coleoptera-active cry7 and cry8 genes. Among the six strains, Btk66 and 
Btm27 were the most promising microbial control agents against S. littoralis. The
present findings were the first to report that Btm27 (classified as B.
thuringiensis var. mexicanensis) is a very potent microbial control agent against
S. littoralis-tested larvae. For more characterization of these two isolates, the
sspO gene was investigated as a molecular chronometer. The DNA sequencing results
proved that Btk66 and Btm27 carry sspO open reading frames with identical
nucleotide sequences, suggesting a strong phylogenetic relationship between the
two strains.

Analysis of the regulation and function of five genes encoding small,
acid-soluble spore proteins of Bacillus subtilis.

Cabrera-Hernandez A(1), Setlow P.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Connecticut Health Center,
Farmington, CT 06032, USA.

Four genes [sspI, sspK, sspM, and sspO (originally called cotK)] encoding minor
small, acid-soluble proteins (SASP) unique to spores of Bacillus subtilis are
expressed only in the forespore compartment of sporulating cells of this
organism. The sspI, sspK and sspM genes are monocistronic, while sspO is the
first gene in a likely operon with sspP (originally called cotL), which also
encodes a putative very small protein. Transcription of these genes is primarily,
if not exclusively, by RNA polymerase with the forespore-specific sigma factor,
sigma(G). Sequences centered 10 and 35nt upstream of the 5'-ends of sspI, sspK,
sspM and sspO also show homology to the -10 and -35 sequences recognized by
sigma(G). Mutations deleting these genes cause the loss of the appropriate SASP
from spores, and the sspK, sspM and sspO (and likely sspP) mutations had no
discernable effect on sporulation, spore properties or spore germination. Loss of
sspI also had no effect on sporulation, spore properties or spore germination,
but DeltasspI spores had a significant defect in spore outgrowth.

BACKGROUND: In this study, molecular biomarkers that play a role in the
development of generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) are investigated using
gingival tissue samples through omics-based whole-genome transcriptomics while
using healthy individuals as background controls.
METHODS: Gingival tissue biopsies from 23 patients with GAgP and 25 healthy
individuals were analyzed using gene-expression microarrays with network and
pathway analyses to identify gene-expression patterns. To substantiate the
results of the microarray studies, real-time quantitative reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to assess the
messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of MZB1 and DSC1. The microarrays and qRT-PCR
resulted in similar gene-expression changes, confirming the reliability of the
microarray results at the mRNA level.
RESULTS: As a result of the gene-expression microarray studies, four significant 
gene networks were identified. The most upregulated genes were found as MZB1,
TNFRSF17, PNOC, FCRL5, LAX1, BMS1P20, IGLL5, MMP7, SPAG4, and MEI1; the most
downregulated genes were found as LOR, LAMB4, AADACL2, MAPT, ARG1, NPR3, AADAC,
DSC1, LRRC4, and CHP2.
CONCLUSIONS: Functions of the identified genes that were involved in gene
networks were cellular development, cell growth and proliferation, cellular
movement, cell-cell signaling and interaction, humoral immune response, protein
synthesis, cell death and survival, cell population and organization, organismal 
injury and abnormalities, molecular transport, and small-molecule biochemistry.
The data suggest new networks that have important functions as humoral immune
response and organismal injury/abnormalities. Future analyses may facilitate
proteomic profiling analyses to identify gene-expression patterns related to
clinical outcome.

We have sequenced a 1.1-Mb region of human chromosome 22q containing the
dosage-sensitive gene(s) responsible for cat eye syndrome (CES) as well as the
450-kb homologous region on mouse chromosome 6. Fourteen putative genes were
identified within or adjacent to the human CES critical region (CESCR), including
three known genes (IL-17R, ATP6E, and BID) and nine novel genes, based on EST
identity. Two putative genes (CECR3 and CECR9) were identified, in the absence of
EST hits, by comparing segments of human and mouse genomic sequence around two
solitary amplified exons, thus showing the utility of comparative genomic
sequence analysis in identifying transcripts. Of the 14 genes, 10 were confirmed 
to be present in the mouse genomic sequence in the same order and orientation as 
in human. Absent from the mouse region of conserved synteny are CECR1, a
promising CES candidate gene from the center of the contig, neighboring CECR4,
and CECR7 and CECR8, which are located in the gene-poor proximal 400 kb of the
contig. This latter proximal region, located approximately 1 Mb from the
centromere, shows abundant duplicated gene fragments typical of pericentromeric
DNA. The margin of this region also delineates the boundary of conserved synteny 
between the CESCR and mouse chromosome 6. Because the proximal CESCR appears
abundant in duplicated segments and, therefore, is likely to be gene poor, we
consider the putative genes identified in the distal CESCR to represent the
majority of candidate genes for involvement in CES.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of curcumin (Cur) on radiosensitivity of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell CNE-2 and its mechanism.
METHOD: The effect of curcumin on radiosensitivity was determined by the clone
formation assay. The cell survival curve was fitted by Graph prism 6. 0. The
changes in cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). The differential
expression of long non-coding RNA was detected by gene chip technology. Part of
differentially expressed genes was verified by Real-time PCR.
RESULT: After 10 micro mol L-1 Cur had worked for 24 h, its sensitization
enhancement ratio was 1. 03, indicating that low concentration of curcumin could 
increase the radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells; FCM displayed a 
significant increase of G2 phase cells and significant decrease of S phase cells 
in the Cur combined radiation group. In the Cur group, the GUCY2GP, H2BFXP,
LINC00623 IncRNA were significantly up-regulated and ZRANB2-AS2 LOC100506835,
FLJ36000 IncRNA were significantly down-regulated.
CONCLUSION: Cur has radiosensitizing effect on human nasopharyngeal carcinoma
CNE-2 cells. Its mechanism may be related to the changes in the cell cycle
distribution and the expression of long non-coding IncRNA.

Breast cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease which necessitates a search 
for markers to provide a more specific classification of this disorder. Long
noncoding RNAs as the important subset of noncoding transcripts have been shown
to be involved in tumorigenic processes. So, they may be used as markers for
early detection of cancer and evaluation of cancer prognosis. In addition, they
can be applied as therapeutic targets. In this study, we analyzed expression of
four long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) namely SOX2OT, PTPRG-AS1, ANRASSF1, and ANRIL 
in 38 breast cancer tissues and their adjacent noncancerous tissues (ANCTs).
ANRASSF1 expression was not detected in any noncancerous tissue. All lncRNAs
showed significant overexpression in tumor tissues compared with ANCTs. No
association was found between gene expressions and individual clinical data such 
as tumor stage, grade, size and hormone receptor status except for ANRASSF1
expression and Her2/neu status. In addition, ANRASSF1 and ANRIL expressions were 
significantly higher in triple negative samples. This study suggests a putative
role for these lncRNAs in breast cancer and implies that they can be used as
potential cancer biomarkers.

Cilia formation and function require a special set of trafficking machinery
termed intraflagellar transport (IFT), consisting mainly of protein complexes
IFT-A, IFT-B, BBSome, and microtubule-dependent molecular motors.
Tetratricopeptide repeat-containing (TTC) proteins are widely involved in protein
complex formation. Nine of them are known to serve as components of the IFT or
BBSome complexes. How many TTC proteins are cilia-related and how they function, 
however, remain unclear. Here we show that twenty TTC genes were upregulated by
at least 2-fold during the differentiation of cultured mouse tracheal epithelial 
cells (MTECs) into multiciliated cells. Our systematic screen in zebrafish
identified four novel TTC genes, ttc4, -9c, -36, and -39c, that are critical for 
cilia formation and motility. Accordingly, their zebrafish morphants displayed
typical ciliopathy-related phenotypes, including curved body, abnormal otolith,
hydrocephalus, and defective left-right patterning. The morphants of ttc4 and
ttc25, a known cilia-related gene, additionally showed pronephric cyst formation.
Immunoprecipitation indicated associations of TTC4, -9c, -25, -36, and -39c with 
components or entire complexes of IFT-A, IFT-B, or BBSome, implying their
participations in IFT or IFT-related activities. Our results provide a global
view for the relationship between TTC proteins and cilia.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, the RFX (Daf19) transcription factor is a major
regulator of ciliogenesis, controlling the expression of the many essential genes
required for making cilia. In vertebrates, however, seven RFX genes have been
identified. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that Rfx2 is among the closest
homologues of Daf19. We therefore hypothesize that Rfx2 broadly controls
ciliogenesis during vertebrate development. Indeed, here we show that Rfx2 in
Xenopus is expressed preferentially in ciliated tissues, including neural tube,
gastrocoel roof plate, epidermal multi-ciliated cells, otic vesicles, and
kidneys. Knockdown of Rfx2 results in cilia-defective embryonic phenotypes and
fewer or truncated cilia are observed in Rfx2 morphants. These results indicate
that Rfx2 is broadly required for ciliogenesis in vertebrates. Furthermore, we
show that Rfx2 is essential for expression of several ciliogenic genes, including
TTC25, which we show here is required for ciliogenesis, HH signaling, and
left-right patterning.

Mucociliary epithelia are essential for homeostasis of many organs and consist of
mucus-secreting goblet cells and ciliated cells. Here, we present the ciliated
epidermis of Xenopus embryos as a facile model system for in vivo molecular
studies of mucociliary epithelial development. Using an in situ
hybridization-based approach, we identified numerous genes expressed
differentially in mucus-secreting cells or in ciliated cells. Focusing on genes
expressed in ciliated cells, we have identified new candidate ciliogenesis
factors, including several not present in the current ciliome. We find that
TTC25-GFP is localized to the base of cilia and to ciliary axonemes, and
disruption of TTC25 function disrupts ciliogenesis. Mig12-GFP localizes very
strongly to the base of cilia and confocal imaging of this construct allows for
simple visualization of the planar polarity of basal bodies that underlies
polarized ciliary beating. Knockdown of Mig12 disrupts ciliogenesis. Finally, we 
show that ciliogenesis factors identified in the Xenopus epidermis are required
in the midline to facilitate neural tube closure. These results provide further
evidence of a requirement for cilia in neural tube morphogenesis and suggest that
genes identified in the Xenopus epidermis play broad roles in ciliogenesis. The
suites of genes identified here will provide a foundation for future studies, and
may also contribute to our understanding of pathological changes in mucociliary
epithelia that accompany diseases such as asthma.

The JmjC domain-containing proteins belong to a large family of oxygenases
possessing distinct substrate specificities which are involved in the regulation 
of different biological processes, such as gene transcription, RNA processing and
translation. Nucleolar protein 66 (NO66) is a JmjC domain-containing protein
which has been reported to be a histone demethylase and a ribosome protein 8
(Rpl8) hydroxylase. The present biochemical study confirmed the hydroxylase
activity of NO66 and showed that oligomerization is required for NO66 to
efficiently catalyze the hydroxylation of Rpl8. The structures of NO66(176-C)
complexed with Rpl8(204-224) in a tetrameric form and of the mutant protein M2 in
a dimeric form were solved. Based on the results of structural and biochemical
analyses, the consensus sequence motif NHXH recognized by NO66 was confirmed.
Several potential substrates of NO66 were found by a BLAST search according to
the consensus sequence motif. When binding to substrate, the relative positions
of each subunit in the NO66 tetramer shift. Oligomerization may facilitate the
motion of each subunit in the NO66 tetramer and affect the catalytic activity.

Osterix and NO66 histone demethylase control the chromatin of Osterix target
genes during osteoblast differentiation.

Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

Commitment of Runx2-expressing precursor osteoblasts to functional osteoblasts
and then to osteocytes is triggered by Osterix (Osx), which activates its target 
genes in those cells during bone formation. It is not yet known whether Osx has a
role in remodeling the chromatin architecture of its target genes during the
transition from preosteoblast to osteoblast. In testing the hypothesis that Osx
is indispensable for active chromatin architecture, we first showed that in
Osx-null calvarial cells occupancy of the transcriptional activators, including
lysine 4 methyl transferase (Wdr5), c-Myc, and H2A.Z, at the Osx target gene Bsp 
was very markedly decreased. The levels of methylation of lysines 4 and 36 and
acetylation of histone H3, markers for active chromatin, were also reduced at the
Bsp gene in these cells. In contrast, occupancy of the transcriptional repressors
HP1 and the nucleolar protein 66 (NO66), a histone demethylase previously
identified as an Osx-interacting protein, was increased at the Bsp gene in
Osx-null calvarial cells. Furthermore, the Bsp promoter was hypermethylated in
embryonic stem (ES) cells and in embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) embryos but was
markedly hypomethylated in the calvaria of E18.5 embryos, coinciding with robust 
Bsp expression. In contrast, CpG methylation in the Bsp promoter remained high in
Osx-null calvaria compared to Osx-wild-type calvaria. Our data also revealed that
NO66 interacted with DNA Methyltransferase 1A (DNMT1A), histone deacetylase 1A
(HDAC1A), and HP1, which are known to control histone and DNA methylation. In
addition, HP1 stimulated the demethylase activity of NO66 for its substrates
"trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4" (H3K4me3) and "trimethylation of
histone H3 at lysine 36" (H3K36me3). Our findings strongly suggest that in the
absence of Osx, the chromatin of Osx target genes is transcriptionally inactive. 
We propose that Osx is a molecular switch for the formation of an active
chromatin state during osteoblast differentiation, whereas NO66 helps gene
repression through histone demethylation and/or formation of a repressor complex,
resulting in multilayered control of the chromatin architecture of specific
osteoblast genes.

Osterix (Osx) is an osteoblast-specific transcriptional factor and is required
for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. A JmjC domain-containing
protein NO66 was previously found to participate in regulation of Osx
transcriptional activity and plays an important role in osteoblast
differentiation through interaction with Osx. Here, we report the crystal
structure of NO66 forming in a functional tetramer. A hinge domain links the
N-terminal JmjC domain and C-terminal winged helix-turn-helix domain of NO66, and
both domains are essential for tetrameric assembly. The oligomerization interface
of NO66 interacts with a conserved fragment of Osx. We show that the hinge
domain-dependent oligomerization of NO66 is essential for inhibition of
Osx-dependent gene activation. Our findings suggest that homo-oligomerization of 
JmjC domain containing proteins might play a physiological role through
interactions with other regulatory factors during gene expression.

The inner ear develops from the otic placode, one of the cranial placodes that
arise from a region of ectoderm adjacent to the anterior neural plate called the 
pre-placodal domain. We have identified a Forkhead family transcription factor,
Foxi3, that is expressed in the pre-placodal domain and down-regulated when the
otic placode is induced. We now show that Foxi3 mutant mice do not form otic
placodes as evidenced by expression changes in early molecular markers and the
lack of thickened placodal ectoderm, an otic cup or otocyst. Some preplacodal
genes downstream of Foxi3-Gata3, Six1 and Eya1-are not expressed in the ectoderm 
of Foxi3 mutant mice, and the ectoderm exhibits signs of increased apoptosis. We 
also show that Fgf signals from the hindbrain and cranial mesoderm, which are
necessary for otic placode induction, are received by pre-placodal ectoderm in
Foxi3 mutants, but do not initiate otic induction. Finally, we show that the
epibranchial placodes that develop in close proximity to the otic placode and the
mandibular division of the trigeminal ganglion are missing in Foxi3 mutants. Our 
data suggest that Foxi3 is necessary to prime pre-placodal ectoderm for the
correct interpretation of inductive signals for the otic and epibranchial
placodes.

Epithelial morphogenesis generates the shape of the tooth crown. This is driven
by patterned differentiation of cells into enamel knots, root-forming cervical
loops and enamel-forming ameloblasts. Enamel knots are signaling centers that
define the positions of cusp tips in a tooth by instructing the adjacent
epithelium to fold and proliferate. Here, we show that the forkhead-box
transcription factor Foxi3 inhibits formation of enamel knots and cervical loops 
and thus the differentiation of dental epithelium in mice. Conditional deletion
of Foxi3 (Foxi3 cKO) led to fusion of molars with abnormally patterned shallow
cusps. Foxi3 was expressed in the epithelium, and its expression was reduced in
the enamel knots and cervical loops and in ameloblasts. Bmp4, a known inducer of 
enamel knots and dental epithelial differentiation, downregulated Foxi3 in
wild-type teeth. Using genome-wide gene expression profiling, we showed that in
Foxi3 cKO there was an early upregulation of differentiation markers, such as
p21, Fgf15 and Sfrp5. Different signaling pathway components that are normally
restricted to the enamel knots were expanded in the epithelium, and Sostdc1, a
marker of the intercuspal epithelium, was missing. These findings indicated that 
the activator-inhibitor balance regulating cusp patterning was disrupted in Foxi3
cKO. In addition, early molar bud morphogenesis and, in particular, formation of 
the suprabasal epithelial cell layer were impaired. We identified keratin 10 as a
marker of suprabasal epithelial cells in teeth. Our results suggest that Foxi3
maintains dental epithelial cells in an undifferentiated state and thereby
regulates multiple stages of tooth morphogenesis.

We report on the molecular characterization of a microdeletion of approximately
2.5 Mb at 2p11.2 in a female baby with left congenital aural atresia, microtia,
and ipsilateral internal carotid artery agenesis. The deletion was characterized 
by fluorescence in situ hybridization, array comparative genomic hybridization,
and whole genome re-sequencing. Among the genes present in the deleted region, we
focused our attention on the FOXI3 gene. Foxi3 is a member of the Foxi class of
Forkhead transcription factors. In mouse, chicken and zebrafish Foxi3 homologues 
are expressed in the ectoderm and endoderm giving rise to elements of the jaw as 
well as external, middle and inner ear. Homozygous Foxi3-/- mice have recently
been generated and show a complete absence of the inner, middle, and external
ears as well as severe defects in the jaw and palate. Recently, a 7-bp
duplication within exon 1 of FOXI3 that produces a frameshift and a premature
stop codon was found in hairless dogs. Mild malformations of the outer auditory
canal (closed ear canal) and ear lobe have also been noted in a fraction of FOXI3
heterozygote Peruvian hairless dogs. Based on the phenotypes of Foxi3 mutant
animals, we propose that FOXI3 may be responsible for the phenotypic features of 
our patient. Further characterization of the genomic region and the analysis of
similar patients may help to demonstrate this point.

Vertebrate cranial sensory organs are derived from region at the border of the
anterior neural plate called the pre-placodal region (PPR). The otic placode, the
anlagen of the inner ear, is induced from PPR ectoderm by FGF signaling. We have 
previously shown that competence of embryonic ectoderm to respond to FGF
signaling during otic placode induction correlates with the expression of PPR
genes, but the molecular basis of this competence is poorly understood. Here, we 
characterize the function of a transcription factor, Foxi3 that is expressed at
very early stages in the non-neural ectoderm and later in the PPR of chick
embryos. Ablation experiments showed that the underlying hypoblast is necessary
for the initiation of Foxi3 expression. Mis-expression of Foxi3 was sufficient to
induce markers of non-neural ectoderm such as Dlx5, and the PPR such as Six1 and 
Eya2. Electroporation of Dlx5, or Six1 together with Eya1 also induced Foxi3,
suggesting direct or indirect positive regulation between non-neural ectoderm
genes and PPR genes. Knockdown of Foxi3 in chick embryos prevented the induction 
of otic placode markers, and was able to prevent competent cranial ectoderm from 
expressing otic markers in response to FGF2. In contrast, Foxi3 expression alone 
was not sufficient to confer competence to respond to FGF on embryonic ectoderm. 
Our analysis of PPR and FGF-responsive genes after Foxi3 knockdown at gastrula
stages suggests it is not necessary for the expression of PPR genes at these
stages, nor for the transduction of FGF signals. The early expression but late
requirement for Foxi3 in ear induction suggests it may have some of the
properties associated with pioneer transcription factors.

The bones of the vertebrate face develop from transient embryonic branchial
arches that are populated by cranial neural crest cells. We have characterized a 
mouse mutant for the Forkhead family transcription factor Foxi3, which is
expressed in branchial ectoderm and endoderm. Foxi3 mutant mice are not viable
and display severe branchial arch-derived facial skeleton defects, including
absence of all but the most distal tip of the mandible and complete absence of
the inner, middle and external ear structures. Although cranial neural crest
cells of Foxi3 mutants are able to migrate, populate the branchial arches, and
display some elements of correct proximo-distal patterning, they succumb to
apoptosis from embryonic day 9.75 onwards. We show this cell death correlates
with a delay in expression of Fgf8 in branchial arch ectoderm and a failure of
neural crest cells in the arches to express FGF-responsive genes. Zebrafish foxi1
is also expressed in branchial arch ectoderm and endoderm, and morpholino
knock-down of foxi1 also causes apoptosis of neural crest in the branchial
arches. We show that heat shock induction of fgf3 in zebrafish arch tissue can
rescue cell death in foxi1 morphants. Our results suggest that Foxi3 may play a
role in the establishment of signaling centers in the branchial arches that are
required for neural crest survival, patterning and the subsequent development of 
branchial arch derivatives.

The fox genes play important roles in various biological processes, including
sexual development. In the present study, we isolated 65 fox genes, belonging to 
18 subfamilies named A-R, from Nile tilapia through genome-wide screening.
Twenty-four of them have two or three (foxm1) copies. Furthermore, 16, 25, 68,
and 45 fox members were isolated from nematodes, protochordates, teleosts, and
tetrapods, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses indicated fox gene family had
undergone three expansions parallel to the three rounds of genome duplication
during evolution. We also analyzed the clustered fox genes and found that
apparent linkage duplication existed in teleosts, which further supported
fish-specific genome duplication hypothesis. In addition, species- and
lineage-specific duplication is another reason for fox gene family expansion.
Based on the four pairs of XX and XY gonadal transcriptome data from four
critical developmental stages, we analyzed the expression profile of all fox
genes and identified sexually dimorphic fox genes at each stage. All fox genes
were detected in gonads, with 15 of them at the background expression level
(total read per kb per million reads, RPKM < 10), 29 at moderate expression level
(10 < total RPKM < 100), and 21 at high expression level (total RPKM > 100).
There are 27, 24, 28, and 9 sexually dimorphic fox genes at 5, 30, 90, and
180 days after hatching (dah), respectively. foxq1a, foxf1, foxr1, and foxr1 were
identified as the most differentially expressed genes at each stage. foxl2 was
characterized as XX-dominant gene, while foxd5, foxi3, foxn3, foxj1a, foxj3b, and
foxo6b were characterized as XY-dominant genes. qPCR and in situ hybridization of
foxh1 and foxj1a were performed to confirm the expression profiles and to
validate the transcriptome data. Our results suggest that fox genes might play
important roles in sex determination and gonadal development in teleosts.

Mammalian tooth development is characterized by formation of primary teeth that
belong to different tooth classes and are later replaced by a single set of
permanent teeth. The first primary teeth are initiated from the primary dental
lamina, and the replacement teeth from the successional dental lamina at the
lingual side of the primary teeth. An interdental lamina connects the primary
tooth germs together. Most mammalian tooth development research is done on mouse,
which does not have teeth in all tooth classes, does not replace its teeth, and
does not develop an interdental lamina. We have used the ferret (Mustela putorius
furo) as a model animal to elucidate the morphological changes and gene
expression during the development of the interdental lamina and the initiation of
primary teeth. In addition we have analyzed cell-cell signaling taking place in
the interdental lamina as well as in the successional lamina during tooth
replacement. By 3D reconstructions of serial histological sections we observed
that the morphogenesis of the interdental lamina and the primary teeth are
intimately linked. Expression of Pitx2 and Foxi3 in the interdental lamina
indicates that it has odontogenic identity, and there is active signaling taking 
place in the interdental lamina. Bmp4 is coexpressed with the stem cell factor
Sox2 at its lingual aspect suggesting that the interdental lamina may retain
competence for tooth initiation. We show that when tooth replacement is initiated
there is Wnt pathway activity in the budding successional lamina and adjacent
mesenchyme but no active Fgf or Eda signaling. Genes associated with human tooth 
replacement phenotypes, including Runx2 and Il11rα, are mostly expressed in the
mesenchyme around the successional lamina in the ferret. Our results highlight
the importance of the dental lamina in the mammalian tooth development during the
initiation of both primary and replacement teeth.

A screen for hydroxymethylcytosine and formylcytosine binding proteins suggests
functions in transcription and chromatin regulation.

Iurlaro M, Ficz G, Oxley D, Raiber EA, Bachman M, Booth MJ, Andrews S,
Balasubramanian S, Reik W.

BACKGROUND: DNA methylation (5mC) plays important roles in epigenetic regulation 
of genome function. Recently, TET hydroxylases have been found to oxidise 5mC to 
hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), formylcytosine (5fC) and carboxylcytosine (5caC) in
DNA. These derivatives have a role in demethylation of DNA but in addition may
have epigenetic signaling functions in their own right. A recent study identified
proteins which showed preferential binding to 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its
oxidised forms, where readers for 5mC and 5hmC showed little overlap, and
proteins bound to further oxidation forms were enriched for repair proteins and
transcription regulators. We extend this study by using promoter sequences as
baits and compare protein binding patterns to unmodified or modified cytosine
using DNA from mouse embryonic stem cell extracts.
RESULTS: We compared protein enrichments from two DNA probes with different CpG
composition and show that, whereas some of the enriched proteins show specificity
to cytosine modifications, others are selective for both modification and target 
sequences. Only a few proteins were identified with a preference for 5hmC (such
as RPL26, PRP8 and the DNA mismatch repair protein MHS6), but proteins with a
strong preference for 5fC were more numerous, including transcriptional
regulators (FOXK1, FOXK2, FOXP1, FOXP4 and FOXI3), DNA repair factors (TDG and
MPG) and chromatin regulators (EHMT1, L3MBTL2 and all components of the NuRD
complex).
CONCLUSIONS: Our screen has identified novel proteins that bind to 5fC in genomic
sequences with different CpG composition and suggests they regulate transcription
and chromatin, hence opening up functional investigations of 5fC readers.

BACKGROUND: Foxi3 is a member of the large forkhead box family of transcriptional
regulators, which have a wide range of biological activities including manifold
developmental processes. Heterozygous mutation in Foxi3 was identified in several
hairless dog breeds characterized by sparse fur coat and missing teeth. A related
phenotype called hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is caused by mutations
in the ectodysplasin (Eda) pathway genes.
RESULTS: Expression of Foxi3 was strictly confined to the epithelium in
developing ectodermal appendages in mouse embryos, but no expression was detected
in the epidermis. Foxi3 was expressed in teeth and hair follicles throughout
embryogenesis, but in mammary glands only during the earliest stages of
development. Foxi3 expression was decreased and increased in Eda loss- and
gain-of-function embryos, respectively, and was highly induced by Eda protein in 
embryonic skin explants. Also activin A treatment up-regulated Foxi3 mRNA levels 
in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Eda and activin A were identified as upstream regulators of Foxi3.
Foxi3 is a likely transcriptional target of Eda in ectodermal appendage placodes 
suggesting that HED phenotype may in part be produced by compromised Foxi3
activity. In addition to hair and teeth, Foxi3 may have a role in nail, eye, and 
mammary, sweat, and salivary gland development.

Expression of the Foxi2 and Foxi3 transcription factors during development of
chicken sensory placodes and pharyngeal arches.

Foxi2 and Foxi3 are members of the Foxi class of Forkhead transcription factors. 
The Foxi transcription factor family has been shown to play roles in the
development of the inner ear and pharyngeal arch derivatives in zebrafish. We
describe the expression of Foxi2 and Foxi3 in chicken embryos during the first
three days of embryonic development. Foxi3 is initially expressed broadly in the 
pre-placodal ectoderm surrounding the neural plate, which will give rise to all
craniofacial sensory organs. It then becomes restricted to a region immediately
anterior to the first pair of somites that will give rise to the otic and
epibranchial placodes, before becoming down-regulated from this region and
restricted to the ectoderm and endoderm of the pharyngeal arches. In contrast,
Foxi2 is initially expressed broadly in cranial ectoderm with the striking
exception of the otic placode, and ultimately becomes restricted to pharyngeal
arch ectoderm. These expression patterns provide an insight into the roles of
these transcriptional regulators during the development of the inner ear and
pharyngeal arch derivatives.
