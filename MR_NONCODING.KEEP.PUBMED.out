The C/D box scaRNA2 is predicted to guide specific 2'-O-methylation of U2 snRNA. 
In contrast to other SCARNA genes, SCARNA2 appears to be independently
transcribed. By transient expression of SCARNA2-reporter gene constructs, we have
demonstrated that this gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase II and that the
promoter elements responsible for its transcription are contained within a 161 bp
region upstream of the transcription start site. In mammals, we have identified
four cross species conserved promoter elements, a TATA motif, an hStaf/ZNF143
binding site and two novel elements that are required for full promoter activity.
Binding of the human hStaf/ZNF143 transcription factor to its target sequence is 
required for promoter activity, suggesting that hStaf/ZNF143 is a fundamental
regulator of the SCARNA2 gene. We also showed that RNA polymerase II continues
transcription past the 3'-end of the mature RNA, irrespective of the identity of 
the Pol II promoter. The 3'-end processing and accumulation are governed by the
sole information contained in the scaRNA2 encoding region, the maturation
occurring via a particular pathway incompatible with that of mRNA or snRNA
production.

There is growing evidence that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are related to
cancer development. In the present study, we found that the expression levels of 
lncRNA-SNHG7 mRNA and protein obviously increased in lung cancer tissues compared
to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Simultaneously, the expression levels of Fas
apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2 (FAIM2) also increased in lung cancer tissues. In
addition, lncRNA-SNHG7 was of positive relevance with FAIM2 in human lung cancer 
tissues. Silence of lncRNA‑SNHG7 by siRNA repressed the level of FAIM2 protein
and suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion and accelerated
apoptosis of A594 cells in vitro. Furthermore, silence of FAIM2 by siRNA
generated a phenotype similar to silence of lncRNA-SNHG7 by siRNA. Therefore, our
research showed that lncRNA-SNHG7 promotes the proliferation, migration and
invasion, and inhibits apoptosis of lung cancer cells by enhancing the FAIM2
expression, suggesting that lncRNA-SNHG7 as a key regulator of gene expression,
may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung cancer. It may 
improve the understanding of their biogenesis and function of lung cancer and
further provide the theoretical fundamental basis for cancer pathogenesis and
treatment.

A wide variety of biological effects are induced in cells that are exposed to
ionizing radiation. The expression changes of coding mRNA and non-coding
micro-RNA have been implicated in irradiated cells. The involvement of other
classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), such as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), long 
ncRNAs (lncRNAs), and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in cells recovering from
radiation-induced damage has not been examined. Thus, we investigated whether
these ncRNA were undergoing changes in cells exposed to ionizing radiation. The
modulation of ncRNAs expression was determined in human TK6 (p53 positive) and
WTK1 (p53 negative) cells. The snoRNA host genes SNHG1, SNHG6, and SNHG11 were
induced in TK6 cells. In WTK1 cells, SNHG1 was induced but SNHG6, and SNHG11 were
repressed. SNHG7 was repressed in TK6 cells and was upregulated in WTK1 cells.
The lncRNA MALAT1 and SOX2OT were induced in both TK6 and WTK1 cells and SRA1 was
induced in TK6 cells only. Interestingly, the MIAT and PIWIL1 were not expressed 
in TK6 cells before or after the ionizing radiation treatment. The MIAT and
PIWIL1 were upregulated in WTK1 cells. This data provides evidence that altered
ncRNA expression is a part of the complex stress response operating in
radiation-treated cells and this response depends on functional p53.

microRNAs (miRNAs), which are small non‑coding RNA molecules, can participate in 
diverse biological functions and act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors by
inhibiting target gene expression. The alteration of miRNA expression is observed
in many types of human cancers and has been implicated in carcinogenesis. Since
miRNAs have been known to be downregulated in most cancer types, there is growing
evidence that several miRNAs are downregulated by DNA hypermethylation. Here, we 
determined that MIR219.2, MIR663b and MIR1237 were transcriptionally silenced by 
DNA hypermethylation in human gastric cancer cell lines. Moreover, we
demonstrated the functional roles of these epigenetically silenced miRNAs by
ectopically expressing them in gastric cancer cells, which caused the suppression
of growth and proliferation. In addition, wound closure, cell migration, and
invasion were significantly reduced in AGS cells following transfection with
MIR219.2, MIR663b or MIR1237 mimics. Notably, epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT)-associated proteins were decreased in response to ectopic
expression of these miRNAs, supporting the notion that these miRNAs have a
tumor-suppressive effect in gastric cancer. We finally predicted the targets of
these miRNAs and identified several candidate genes, the expression levels of
which were significantly downregulated by ectopic expression of MIR219.2, MIR663b
or MIR1237 mimics in the gastric cancer cell lines. Our study provides strong
evidence that these miRNAs are transcriptionally regulated by DNA methylation in 
gastric cancer and have tumor-suppressive roles by decreasing the mesenchymal
traits in cancer as well as by targeting cancer-associated genes.

Regulators of the histone H3-trimethyl lysine-4 (H3K4me3) mark are significantly 
associated with the genetic risk architecture of common neurodevelopmental
disease, including schizophrenia and autism. Typical H3K4me3 is primarily
localized in the form of sharp peaks, extending in neuronal chromatin on average 
only across 500-1500 base pairs mostly in close proximity to annotated
transcription start sites. Here, through integrative computational analysis of
epigenomic and transcriptomic data based on next-generation sequencing, we
investigated H3K4me3 landscapes of sorted neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei in
human postmortem, non-human primate and mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), and blood.
To explore whether H3K4me3 peak signals could also extend across much broader
domains, we examined broadest domain cell-type-specific H3K4me3 peaks in an
unbiased manner with an innovative approach on 41+12 ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data
sets. In PFC neurons, broadest H3K4me3 distribution ranged from 3.9 to 12 kb,
with extremely broad peaks (~10 kb or broader) related to synaptic function and
GABAergic signaling (DLX1, ELFN1, GAD1, IGSF9B and LINC00966). Broadest neuronal 
peaks showed distinct motif signatures and were centrally positioned in
prefrontal gene-regulatory Bayesian networks and sensitive to defective
neurodevelopment. Approximately 120 of the broadest H3K4me3 peaks in human PFC
neurons, including many genes related to glutamatergic and dopaminergic
signaling, were fully conserved in chimpanzee, macaque and mouse cortical
neurons. Exploration of spread and breadth of lysine methylation markings could
provide novel insights into epigenetic mechanism involved in neuropsychiatric
disease and neuronal genome evolution.

Breastmilk has many documented beneficial effects on the developing human infant,
but the components of breastmilk that influence these developmental pathways have
not been fully elucidated. Increasing evidence suggests that non-coding RNAs
encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent an important mechanism of 
communication between the mother and child. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are of
particular interest given their key role in gene expression and development.
However, it is not known whether breastmilk EVs contain lncRNAs. We used qRT-PCR 
to determine whether EVs isolated from human breastmilk contain lncRNAs
previously reported to be important for developmental processes. We detected 55
of the 87 screened lncRNAs in EVs from the 30 analyzed breastmilk samples, and
CRNDE, DANCR GAS5, SRA1 and ZFAS1 were detected in >90% of the samples. GAS5,
SNHG8 and ZFAS1 levels were highly correlated (Spearman's rho>0.9; P<0.0001),
which may indicate that the loading of these lncRNAs into breastmilk EVs is
regulated by the same pathways. The detected lncRNAs are important epigenetic
regulators involved in processes such as immune cell regulation and metabolism.
They may target a repertoire of recipient cells in offspring and could be
essential for child development and health. Further experimental and
epidemiological studies are warranted to determine the impact of breastmilk
EV-encapsulated lnRNAs in mother to child signaling.

Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) is one of the most
common congenital birth defects. NSCL/P is a complex multifactorial disease
caused by interactions between multiple environmental and genetic factors.
However, the causal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) signature profile
underlying the risk of familial NSCL/P still remains unknown. We previously
reported a 5.7-Mb genomic region on chromosome 18q21.1 locus that potentially
contributes to autosomal dominant, low-penetrance inheritance of NSCL/P. In the
current study, we performed exome sequencing on 12 familial genomes (six affected
individuals, two obligate carriers, and four seemingly unaffected individuals) of
a six-generation family to identify candidate SNPs associated with NSCL/P risk.
Subsequently, targeted bidirectional DNA re-sequencing of polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-amplified high-risk regions of MYO5B gene and sequenom iPLEX
genotpying of 29 candidate SNPs were performed on a larger set of 33 members of
this NSCL/P family (10 affected + 4 obligate carriers + 19 unaffected relatives) 
to find SNPs significantly associated with NSCL/P trait. SNP vs. NSCL/P
association analysis showed the MYO5B SNP rs183559995 GA genotype had an odds
ratio of 18.09 (95% Confidence Interval = 1.86-176.34; gender-adjusted P =
0.0019) compared to the reference GG genotype. Additionally, the following SNPs
were also found significantly associated with NSCL/P risk: rs1450425 (LOXHD1),
rs6507992 (SKA1), rs78950893 (SMAD7), rs8097060, rs17713847 (SCARNA17), rs6507872
(CTIF), rs8091995 (CTIF), and rs17715416 (MYO5B). We could thus identify
mutations in several genes as key candidate SNPs associated with the risk of
NSCL/P in this large multi-generation family.

MicroRNAs comprise a family of small non-coding RNAs that modulate several
developmental and physiological processes including pregnancy. Their ubiquitous
presence is confirmed in mammals, worms, flies and plants. Although rapid
advances have been made in microRNA research, information on stable reference
genes for validation of microRNA expression is still lacking. Real time PCR is a 
widely used tool to quantify gene transcripts. An appropriate reference gene must
be chosen to minimize experimental error in this system. A small difference in
miRNA levels between experimental samples can be biologically meaningful as these
entities can affect multiple targets in a pathway. This study examined the
suitability of six commercially available reference genes (RNU1A, RNU5A, RNU6B,
SNORD25, SCARNA17, and SNORA73A) in maternal-fetal tissues from healthy and
spontaneously arresting/dying conceptuses from sows were separately analyzed at
gestation day 20. Comparisons were also made with non-pregnant endometrial
tissues from sows. Spontaneous fetal loss is a prime concern to the commercial
pork industry. Our laboratory has previously identified deficits in vasculature
development at maternal-fetal interface as one of the major participating causes 
of fetal loss. Using this well-established model, we have extended our studies to
identify suitable microRNA reference genes. A methodical approach to assessing
suitability was adopted using standard curve and melting curve analysis, PCR
product sequencing, real time PCR expression in a panel of gestational tissues,
and geNorm and NormFinder analysis. Our quantitative real time PCR analysis
confirmed expression of all 6 reference genes in maternal and fetal tissues. All 
genes were uniformly expressed in tissues from healthy and spontaneously
arresting conceptus attachment sites. Comparisons between tissue types
(maternal/fetal/non-pregnant) revealed significant differences for RNU5A, RNU6B, 
SCARNA17, and SNORA73A expression. Based on our methodical assessment of all 6
reference genes, results suggest that RNU1A is the most stable reference gene for
porcine pregnancy studies.

RNA-binding proteins (RBP) regulate numerous aspects of co- and
post-transcriptional gene expression in cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate that
RBP, fragile X-related protein 1 (FXR1), plays an essential role in cellular
senescence by utilizing mRNA turnover pathway. We report that overexpressed FXR1 
in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma targets (G-quadruplex (G4) RNA structure
within) both mRNA encoding p21 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A,
Cip1) and the non-coding RNA Telomerase RNA Component (TERC), and regulates their
turnover to avoid senescence. Silencing of FXR1 in cancer cells triggers the
activation of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitors, p53, increases DNA damage, and 
ultimately, cellular senescence. Overexpressed FXR1 binds and destabilizes p21
mRNA, subsequently reduces p21 protein expression in oral cancer cells. In
addition, FXR1 also binds and stabilizes TERC RNA and suppresses the cellular
senescence possibly through telomerase activity. Finally, we report that
FXR1-regulated senescence is irreversible and FXR1-depleted cells fail to form
colonies to re-enter cellular proliferation. Collectively, FXR1 displays a novel 
mechanism of controlling the expression of p21 through p53-dependent manner to
bypass cellular senescence in oral cancer cells.

RAP1 is one of the components of shelterin, the capping complex at chromosome
ends or telomeres, although its role in telomere length maintenance and
protection has remained elusive. RAP1 also binds subtelomeric repeats and along
chromosome arms, where it regulates gene expression and has been shown to
function in metabolism control. Telomerase is the enzyme that elongates
telomeres, and its deficiency causes a premature aging in humans and mice. We
describe an unanticipated genetic interaction between RAP1 and telomerase. While 
RAP1 deficiency alone does not impact on mouse survival, mice lacking both RAP1
and telomerase show a progressively decreased survival with increasing mouse
generations compared to telomerase single mutants. Telomere shortening is more
pronounced in Rap1(-/-) Terc(-/-) doubly deficient mice than in the single-mutant
Terc(-/-) counterparts, leading to an earlier onset of telomere-induced DNA
damage and degenerative pathologies. Telomerase deficiency abolishes obesity and 
liver steatohepatitis provoked by RAP1 deficiency. Using genomewide ChIP
sequencing, we find that progressive telomere shortening owing to telomerase
deficiency leads to re-localization of RAP1 from telomeres and subtelomeric
regions to extratelomeric sites in a genomewide manner. These findings suggest
that although in the presence of sufficient telomere reserve RAP1 is not a key
factor for telomere maintenance and protection, it plays a crucial role in the
context of telomerase deficiency, thus in agreement with its evolutionary
conservation as a telomere component from yeast to humans.

BACKGROUND: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is the most common
cystic preneoplastic lesion of pancreatic cancer. We used an approach coupling
high resolution cytogenetic analysis (Affymetrix Oncoscan FFPE Array) with
clinically-oriented bioinformatic interpretation of data to understand the most
relevant alterations of precursor lesions at different stages to identify new
diagnostic markers.
RESULTS: We identified multiple copy number alterations, particularly in lesions 
with severe dysplasia, with 7 IPMN with low-intermediate dysplasia carrying a
nearly normal karyotype and 13 IPMN with complex Karyotype (> 4 alterations),
showing high grade dysplasia. A specific gain of chromosome arm 3q was found in
IPMN with complex Karyotype (92%). This gain of 3q is particularly interesting
for the presence of oncogenes such as PIK3CA, GATA2 and TERC that are part of
pathways that deregulate cell growth and promote disease progression.
Quantitative PCR and FISH analysis confirmed the data . Further demonstration of 
the overexpression of the PIK3CA gene supports the identification of this
alteration as a possible biomarker in the early identification of patients with
IPMN at higher risk for disease progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: High resolution cytogenetic analysis was performed in 20
formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples of IPMN by Oncoscan FFPE assay. Results 
were validated by qPCR and FISH analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The identification of these markers at an early stage of disease
onset could help to identify patients at risk for cancer progression and new
candidates for a more specific targeted therapy.

Heterozygous mutations in four telomere-related genes have been linked to
pulmonary fibrosis, but little is known about similarities or differences of
affected individuals.115 patients with mutations in telomerase reverse
transcriptase (TERT) (n=75), telomerase RNA component (TERC) (n=7), regulator of 
telomere elongation helicase 1 (RTEL1) (n=14) and poly(A)-specific ribonuclease
(PARN) (n=19) were identified and clinical data were analysed.Approximately
one-half (46%) had a multidisciplinary diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF); others had unclassifiable lung fibrosis (20%), chronic hypersensitivity
pneumonitis (12%), pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (10%), interstitial pneumonia
with autoimmune features (7%), an idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (4%) and
connective tissue disease-related interstitial fibrosis (3%). Discordant
interstitial lung disease diagnoses were found in affected individuals from 80%
of families. Patients with TERC mutations were diagnosed at an earlier age than
those with PARN mutations (51±11 years versus 64±8 years; p=0.03) and had a
higher incidence of haematological comorbidities. The mean rate of forced vital
capacity decline was 300 mL·year(-1) and the median time to death or transplant
was 2.87 years. There was no significant difference in time to death or
transplant for patients across gene mutation groups or for patients with a
diagnosis of IPF versus a non-IPF diagnosis.Genetic mutations in telomere related
genes lead to a variety of interstitial lung disease (ILD) diagnoses that are
universally progressive.

BACKGROUND: Xiangjiang River (Hunan, China) has been contaminated with heavy
metal for several decades by surrounding factories. However, little is known
about the influence of a gradient of heavy metal contamination on the diversity, 
structure of microbial functional gene in sediment. To deeply understand the
impact of heavy metal contamination on microbial community, a comprehensive
functional gene array (GeoChip 5.0) has been used to study the functional genes
structure, composition, diversity and metabolic potential of microbial community 
from three heavy metal polluted sites of Xiangjiang River.
RESULTS: A total of 25595 functional genes involved in different biogeochemical
processes have been detected in three sites, and different diversities and
structures of microbial functional genes were observed. The analysis of gene
overlapping, unique genes, and various diversity indices indicated a significant 
correlation between the level of heavy metal contamination and the functional
diversity. Plentiful resistant genes related to various metal were detected, such
as copper, arsenic, chromium and mercury. The results indicated a significantly
higher abundance of genes involved in metal resistance including sulfate
reduction genes (dsr) in studied site with most serious heavy metal
contamination, such as cueo, mer, metc, merb, tehb and terc gene. With regard to 
the relationship between the environmental variables and microbial functional
structure, S, Cu, Cd, Hg and Cr were the dominating factor shaping the microbial 
distribution pattern in three sites.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that high level of heavy metal contamination
resulted in higher functional diversity and the abundance of metal resistant
genes. These variation therefore significantly contribute to the resistance,
resilience and stability of the microbial community subjected to the gradient of 
heavy metals contaminant in Xiangjiang River.

Telomeres cap chromosome ends, protecting them from degradation, double-strand
breaks, and end-to-end fusions. Telomeres are maintained by telomerase, a reverse
transcriptase encoded by TERT, and an RNA template encoded by TERC. Loci in the
TERT and adjoining CLPTM1L region are associated with risk of multiple cancers.
We therefore investigated associations between variants in 22 telomere structure 
and maintenance gene regions and colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian, and lung 
cancer risk. We performed subset-based meta-analyses of 204,993 directly-measured
and imputed SNPs among 61,851 cancer cases and 74,457 controls of European
descent. Independent associations for SNP minor alleles were identified using
sequential conditional analysis (with gene-level p value cutoffs ≤3.08 × 10(-5)
). Of the thirteen independent SNPs observed to be associated with cancer risk,
novel findings were observed for seven loci. Across the DCLRE1B region, rs974494 
and rs12144215 were inversely associated with prostate and lung cancers, and
colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers, respectively. Across the TERC region,
rs75316749 was positively associated with colorectal, breast, ovarian, and lung
cancers. Across the DCLRE1B region, rs974404 and rs12144215 were inversely
associated with prostate and lung cancers, and colorectal, breast, and prostate
cancers, respectively. Near POT1, rs116895242 was inversely associated with
colorectal, ovarian, and lung cancers, and RTEL1 rs34978822 was inversely
associated with prostate and lung cancers. The complex association patterns in
telomere-related genes across cancer types may provide insight into mechanisms
through which telomere dysfunction in different tissues influences cancer risk.

OBJECTIVE: Diabetes during pregnancy causes an intrauterine environment that
influences lifetime sickness of the mother and the fetus. There is a correlation 
between diabetes and telomere shortening; however, very little is known about
telomere homeostasis in the placenta. We aimed to study the telomerase complex in
placentas and in cord blood leukocytes from patients with poorly controlled
diabetes.
METHODS: Biopsies from 16 third-trimester placentas and cord blood samples from
pregnancies complicated with uncontrolled diabetes and from 16 gestational
age-matched controls from uncomplicated pregnancies were examined. The expression
of hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) was evaluated by
immunohistochemistry and by RT-RCR. TERC gene copy number and telomere capture
were evaluated by FISH.
RESULTS: Telomerase expression was significantly lower in the diabetic placentas,
both the protein (17.8 ± 2.8% cellular staining vs. 37 ± 5.32%, P = 0.012) and
the mRNA levels (0.42 ± 0.03 folds, P = 0.022). Lower expression of TERC gene
copy number were shown in the diabetic placentas compared to the healthy controls
(1.7 ± 0.8% vs. 3.7 ± 1.6%, P = 0.035). We also detected higher percentage of
cells with telomere capture among the diabetic trophoblasts compared to the
healthy controls (19.8 ± 5.12% vs. 9.6 ± 3.65%, P = 0.038). Those differences
were not observed in cord blood leukocytes from the same samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Uncontrolled diabetes during pregnancy disrupts telomere-telomerase 
homeostasis in the trophoblasts. These changes may increase the risk for
metabolic diseases in adulthood among offspring of pregnancies complicated by
gestational diabetes mellitus as part of intrauterine programming. These
variations were not observed in cord blood leukocytes, which imply different
telomere homeostasis mechanisms in fetal cord blood.

1. Dyskeratosis Congenita.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a telomere biology
disorder, is characterized by a classic triad of dysplastic nails, lacy reticular
pigmentation of the upper chest and/or neck, and oral leukoplakia. The classic
triad may not be present in all individuals. People with DC are at increased risk
for progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or
acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), solid tumors (usually squamous cell carcinoma
of the head/neck or anogenital cancer), and pulmonary fibrosis. Other findings
can include: abnormal pigmentation changes not restricted to the upper chest and 
neck, eye abnormalities (epiphora, blepharitis, sparse eyelashes, ectropion,
entropion, trichiasis), and dental abnormalities (caries, periodontal disease,
taurodauntism). Although most persons with DC have normal psychomotor development
and normal neurologic function, significant developmental delay is present in the
two variants in which additional findings include cerebellar hypoplasia (Hoyeraal
Hreidarsson syndrome) and bilateral exudative retinopathy and intracranial
calcifications (Revesz syndrome). Onset and progression of manifestations of DC
vary: at the mild end of the spectrum are those who have only minimal physical
findings with normal bone marrow function, and at the severe end are those who
have the diagnostic triad and early-onset BMF.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: All individuals with DC have abnormally short telomeres for
their age, as determined by multicolor flow cytometry fluorescence in situ
hybridization (flow-FISH) on white blood cell (WBC) subsets. To date, ACD, CTC1, 
DKC1, NHP2, NOP10, PARN, RTEL1, TERC, TERT, TINF2, and WRAP53 are the genes in
which pathogenic variants are known to cause DC and result in very short
telomeres. Pathogenic variants in one of these eleven genes have been identified 
in approximately 70% of individuals who meet clinical diagnostic criteria for DC.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is tailored to the individual.
Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment for BMF
and leukemia but historically has had poor long-term efficacy; if a suitable
donor is not available, androgen therapy may be considered for BMF. Treatment of 
other cancers is tailored to the type of cancer. Of note, cancer therapy may pose
an increased risk for prolonged cytopenias as well as pulmonary and hepatic
toxicity. Treatment of pulmonary fibrosis is primarily supportive, although lung 
transplantation may be considered. Surveillance: For BMF: complete blood count
(CBC) annually if normal and more often if abnormal; consider annual bone marrow 
aspirate and biopsy. For those on androgen therapy: routine monitoring of liver
function. For cancer risk: monthly self-examination for oral, head, and neck
cancer; annual cancer screening by an otolaryngologist and dermatologist; annual 
gynecologic examination. For pulmonary fibrosis: annual pulmonary function tests 
starting either at diagnosis or when the individual can perform the test (often
around age eight years). Routine dental screening every six months and good oral 
hygiene are recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Blood donation by family 
members if HCT is being considered; non-leukodepleted and non-irradiated blood
products; the combination of androgens and G-CSF in treatment of BMF (has been
associated with splenic rupture); toxic agents implicated in tumorigenesis (e.g.,
smoking). Evaluation of relatives at risk: If a relative has signs or symptoms
suggestive of DC or is being evaluated as a potential HCT donor, telomere length 
testing is warranted or molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in
the family are known.
GENETIC COUNSELING: The mode of inheritance of DC varies by gene: X-linked: DKC1.
Autosomal dominant: TERC and TINF2. Autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive:
ACD, RTEL1, and TERT. Autosomal recessive: CTC1, NHP2, NOP10, PARN, and WRAP53.
Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate
diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results
of molecular genetic testing. Once the DC-related pathogenic variant(s) have been
identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at
increased risk for DC is possible.

Current debate in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has focused on shortened leukocyte
telomere length (LTL) as the result of a number of possible causes, including
polymorphisms in mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs) leading to oxidative
stress, telomere regulatory pathway gene polymorphisms, or as a direct result of 
associated cardiovascular complications inducing tissue organ inflammation and
oxidative stress. There is evidence that a heritable shorter telomere trait is a 
risk factor for development of T2DM. This review discusses the contribution and
balance of genetic regulation of UCPs and telomere pathways in the context of
T2DM. We discuss genotypes that are well known to influence the shortening of
LTL, in particular OBFC1 and telomerase genotypes such as TERC. Interestingly,
the interaction between short telomeres and T2DM risk appears to involve
mitochondrial dysfunction as an intermediate process. A hypothesis is presented
that genetic heterogeneity within UCPs may directly affect oxidative stress that 
feeds back to influence the fine balance of telomere regulation, cell cycle
regulation and diabetes risk and/or metabolic disease progression.

and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China. Electronic address: borismq@163.com.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to analyze the relationships of long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) and protein-coding genes in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC).
METHODS: RNA-seq data of LUSC deposited in the TCGA database were used to
identify differentially expressed protein-coding genes (DECGs) and differentially
expressed lncRNA genes (DE-lncRNAs) between LUSC samples and normal samples.
Functional enrichment analysis of DECGs was then performed. Subsequently, the
target genes and regulators of DE-lncRNAs were predicted from the DECGs.
Additionally, expression levels of target genes of DE-lncRNAs were validated by
RT-qPCR after the silence of DE-lncRNAs.
RESULTS: In total, 5162 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened from 
the LUSC samples, and there were seven upregulated lncRNA genes in the DEGs. The 
upregulated DECGs were enriched in GO terms like RNA binding and metabolic
process. Meanwhile, the downregulated DECGs were enriched in GO terms like cell
cycle. Furthermore, the lncRNAs PVT1 and TERC targeted multiple DECGs. PVT1
targeted genes related to cell cycle (e.g. POLA2, POLD1, MCM4, MCM5 and MCM6),
and reduced expression of PVT1 decreased expression of the genes. TERC regulated 
several genes (e.g. NDUFAB1, NDUFA11 and NDUFB5), and reduced expression of TERC 
increased expression of the genes. Additionally, PVT1 was regulated by multiple
transcription factors (TFs) identified from DECGs, such as HSF1; and TERC was
modulated by TFs, such as PIR.
CONCLUSION: A set of regulatory relationships between PVT1 and its targets and
regulators, as well as TERC and its targets and regulators, may play crucial
roles in the progress of LUSC.

The brain endothelium is an important therapeutic target for the inhibition of
cerebrovascular dysfunction in ischemic stroke. Previously, we documented the
important regulatory roles of microRNAs in the cerebral vasculature, in
particular the cerebral vascular endothelium. However, the functional
significance and molecular mechanisms of other classes of non-coding RNAs in the 
regulation of cerebrovascular endothelial pathophysiology after stroke are
completely unknown. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology, we profiled long
non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expressional signatures in primary brain microvascular
endothelial cells (BMECs) after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro
mimic of ischemic stroke conditions. After 16h of OGD exposure, the expression
levels for 362 of the 10,677 lncRNAs analyzed changed significantly, including a 
total of 147 lncRNAs increased and 70 lncRNAs decreased by more than 2-fold.
Among them, the most highly upregulated lncRNAs include Snhg12, Malat1, and
lnc-OGD 1006, whereas the most highly downregulated lncRNAs include 281008D09Rik,
Peg13, and lnc-OGD 3916. Alteration of the most highly upregulated/downregulated 
ODG-responsive lncRNAs was further confirmed in cultured BMECs after OGD as well 
as isolated cerebral microvessels in mice following transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) and 24h reperfusion by the quantitative real-time PCR
approach. Moreover, promoter analysis of altered ODG-responsive endothelial
lncRNA genes by bioinformatics showed substantial transcription factor binding
sites on lncRNAs, implying potential transcriptional regulation of those lncRNAs.
These findings are the first to identify OGD-responsive brain endothelial
lncRNAs, which suggest potential pathological roles for these lncRNAs in
mediating endothelial responses to ischemic stimuli. Endothelial-selective
lncRNAs may function as a class of novel master regulators in cerebrovascular
endothelial pathologies after ischemic stroke.

The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) small nucleolar RNA host gene 12 (SNHG12) has a 
role in cell proliferation and migration. Angiomotin, encoded by the AMOT gene,
is a protein that regulates the migration and organization of endothelial cells. 
SNHG12 and AMOT have been shown to play a role in a variety of human cancers but 
have yet to be studied in detail in human osteosarcoma. Tissue samples from
primary osteosarcoma (n = 20) and adjacent normal tissues (n = 20), the
osteosarcoma cell lines, SAOS-2, MG-63, U-2 OS, and the human osteoblast cell
line hFOB (OB3) were studied using Western blot for angiomotin, and quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction for the expression of SNHG12 and AMOT. The
expression of SNHG12 was knocked down using RNA interference. Cell migration
assays were performed. Cell apoptosis was studied using flow cytometry. SNHG12
and AMOT messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was upregulated in osteosarcoma tissues 
and cell lines when compared with normal tissues and cells. Upregulation of AMOT 
mRNA was associated with upregulation of SNHG12. Knockdown of SNHG12 reduced the 
expression of angiomotin in osteosarcoma cells and suppressed cell proliferation 
and migration but did not affect cell apoptosis. This preliminary study has shown
that the lncRNA SNHG12 promotes cell proliferation and migration by upregulating 
AMOT gene expression in osteosarcoma cells in vivo and in vitro. Further studies 
are recommended to investigate the role of SNHG12 and AMOT expression in tumor
cell proliferation and migration and angiogenesis in osteosarcoma and a range of 
malignant mesenchymal tumors.

Researchers have recently demonstrated the key role of long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) in regulating embryogenesis and gene expression. However, the exact
mechanism used by lncRNAs in carcinogenesis is still unclear. In particular,
studies regarding the role of lncRNAs in vulvar squamous cell carcinomas (VSCCs) 
are limited. Using microarray analysis, the genome-wide expression profile of
lncRNAs was investigated in four paired VSCCs and adjacent normal vulvar tissues.
Accordingly, several novel lncRNA candidates (HOAIR, MALAT1, MEG3, NEAT1, MIR31HG
and LINC00478) were chosen for further study and real-time reverse transcription 
PCR (RT-PCR) was used to confirm the expression levels among 35 tissue samples. A
panel of dysregulated lncRNAs (MEG3 and MALAT1) were also identified as potential
biomarkers as they also correlated with VSCC carcinogenesis. In summary, the
results revealed that aberrantly expressed lncRNAs may be a factor in VSCC
pathogenesis, potentially providing new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for
VSCC.

to breast tumorigenesis.

Dysregulation of long non-codng RNA (lncRNA) expression has been found to
contribute to tumorigenesis. However, the roles of lncRNAs in BRCA1-related
breast cancer remain largely unknown. In this study, we delineate the role of the
novel BRCA1/lncRNA NEAT1 signaling axis in breast tumorigenesis. BRCA1 inhibits
NEAT1 expression potentially through binding to its genomic binding site upstream
of the NEAT1 gene. BRCA1 deficiency in human normal/cancerous breast cells and
mouse mammary glands leads to NEAT1 overexpression. Our studies show that NEAT1
upregulation resulting from BRCA1 deficiency stimulates in vitro and in vivo
breast tumorigenicity. We have further identified molecular mediators downstream 
of the BRCA1/NEAT1 axis. NEAT1 epigenetically silences miR-129-5p expression by
promoting the DNA methylation of the CpG island in the miR-129 gene. Silencing of
miR-129-5p expression by NEAT1 results in upregulation of WNT4 expression, a
target of miR-129-5p, which leads to activation of oncogenic WNT signaling. Our
functional studies indicate that this NEAT1/miR-129-5p/WNT4 axis contributes to
the tumorigenic effects of BRCA1 deficiency. Finally our in silico expression
correlation analysis suggests the existence of the BRCA1/NEAT1/miR-129-5p axis in
breast cancer. Our findings, taken together, suggest that the dysregulation of
the BRCA1/NEAT1/miR-129-5p/WNT4 signaling axis is involved in promoting breast
tumorigenesis.

RUNX1 is a transcription factor functioning both as an oncogene and a tumor
suppressor in breast cancer. RUNX1 alters chromatin structure in cooperation with
chromatin modifier and remodeling enzymes. In this study, we examined the
relationship between RUNX1-mediated transcription and genome organization. We
characterized genome-wide RUNX1 localization and performed RNA-seq and Hi-C in
RUNX1-depleted and control MCF-7 breast cancer cells. RNA-seq analysis showed
that RUNX1 depletion led to up-regulation of genes associated with chromatin
structure and down-regulation of genes related to extracellular matrix biology,
as well as NEAT1 and MALAT1 lncRNAs. Our ChIP-Seq analysis supports a prominent
role for RUNX1 in transcriptional activation. About 30% of all RUNX1 binding
sites were intergenic, indicating diverse roles in promoter and enhancer
regulation and suggesting additional functions for RUNX1. Hi-C analysis of
RUNX1-depleted cells demonstrated that overall three-dimensional genome
organization is largely intact, but indicated enhanced association of RUNX1 near 
Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) boundaries and alterations in long-range
interactions. These results suggest an architectural role for RUNX1 in
fine-tuning local interactions rather than in global organization. Our results
provide novel insight into RUNX1-mediated perturbations of higher-order genome
organization that are functionally linked with RUNX1-dependent compromised gene
expression in breast cancer cells.

Overexpression of lncRNA NEAT1 mitigates multidrug resistance by inhibiting ABCG2
in leukemia.

Leukemia is a heterogeneous clonal disorder in which early hematopoietic cells
fail to differentiate and do not undergo programmed cell death or apoptosis. Less
than one-third of adult patients with leukemia are managed using current
therapies due to the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR), emphasizing the
need for newer and more robust approaches. Recent reports have suggested that
long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to selective gene expression and,
hence, could be manipulated effectively to halt the progression of cancer.
However, little is known regarding the role of lncRNA in leukemia. Nuclear
paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) is a nuclear-restricted lncRNA involved
in the pathogenesis of certain types of cancer. Deregulated expression of NEAT1
has been reported in a number of human malignancies, including leukemia and other
solid tumors. The present study aimed to characterize the role of NEAT1 in the
regulation of MDR in leukemia. Using reverse transcription-quantitative
polymerase chain reaction, it was demonstrated that NEAT1 messenger RNA (mRNA)
expression levels were significantly downregulated in leukemia patient samples
compared with those from healthy donors. Furthermore, NEAT1 mRNA expression was
repressed in a number of leukemia cell lines, including K562, THP-1, HL-60 and
Jurkat cells, compared with peripheral white blood control cells, consistent with
the expression observed in patients with leukemia. In addition, the transfection 
of a NEAT1 overexpression plasmid into K562 and THP-1 leukemia cell lines
alleviated MDR induced by cytotoxic agents, such as Alisertib and Bortezomib,
through inhibition of ATP-binding cassette G2. Although more robust studies are
warranted, the current findings provide the basis for the use of NEAT1 as a novel
promising target in the treatment of leukemia.

Paraspeckles are nuclear bodies form around the long non-coding RNA, Neat1, and
RNA-binding proteins. While their role is not fully understood, they are believed
to control gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by means of the
nuclear retention of mRNA containing in their 3'-UTR inverted repeats of Alu
sequences (IRAlu). In this study, we found that, in pituitary cells, all
components of paraspeckles including four major proteins and Neat1 displayed a
circadian expression pattern. Furthermore the insertion of IRAlu at the 3'-UTR of
the EGFP cDNA led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the egfp mRNA that
was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted whereas insertion of a single antisense
Alu had only a weak effect. Using real-time video-microscopy, these IRAlu were
further shown to drive a circadian expression of EGFP protein. This study shows
that paraspeckles, thanks to their circadian expression, control circadian gene
expression at a post-transcriptional level.

Bladder cancer was the most important reason of cancer-related death around the
world, and urgently requires new therapeutic methods targeting the malignant
tumor. There are many reports that the long noncoding RNAs are participated in
different cancers, however, limited data are found between the long noncoding
RNAs and bladder cancer. Previous studies have indicated that lncRNAs play vital 
roles in gene regulatory processes which could influence carcinoma progression.It
is well known that lncRNAs can't code proteins, however, controlling
transcription was found in the life process.In the current study,we firstly
reported that NEAT1 was consistently up-regulated in bladder cancer tissues
compared to the matched tissues and bladder cancer cell lines compared to the
normal bladder epithelial cell and the expression level of the NEAT1 in bladder
cancer tissues is closely related to its clinical pathologic grade and TNM phase.
Cell proliferation inhibition, cell migration suppression and apoptosis induction
were detected by knockdown NEAT1. However, it is imperative that this hypothesis 
is further tested through. In conclusion, NEAT1 may play oncogenic roles and can 
be used as a therapeutic target for treating human bladder cancer. Our finding
provides a new insight into the role of the LncRNA NEAT1 in the bladder cancer.

Recently, the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1 has been identified as an
oncogenic gene in multiple cancer types and elevated expression of NEAT1 was
tightly linked to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, the molecular
basis for this observation has not been characterized in progression of non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In our studies, we identified NEAT1 was highly
expressed in patients with NSCLC and was a novel regulator of NSCLC progression. 
Patients whose tumors had high NEAT1 expression had a shorter overall survival
than patients whose tumors had low NEAT1 expression. Further, NEAT1 significantly
accelerates NSCLC cell growth and metastasis in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.
Additionally, by using bioinformatics study and RNA pull down combined with
luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrated that NEAT1 functioned as a competing 
endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for hsa-miR-377-3p, antagonized its functions and led to
the de-repression of its endogenous targets E2F3, which was a core oncogene in
promoting NSCLC progression. Taken together, these observations imply that the
NEAT1 modulated the expression of E2F3 gene by acting as a ceRNA, which may build
up the missing link between the regulatory miRNA network and NSCLC progression.

The long non-coding RNAs in neurodegenerative diseases: novel mechanisms of
pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Long-non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), RNA molecules longer than 200
nucleotides, have been involved in several biological processes and in a growing 
number of diseases, controlling gene transcription, pre-mRNA processing, the
transport of mature mRNAs to specific cellular compartments, the regulation of
mRNA stability, protein translation and turnover. The fundamental role of lncRNAs
in central nervous system (CNS) is becoming increasingly evident. LncRNAs are
abundantly expressed in mammalian CNS in a specific spatio-temporal manner
allowing a quick response to environmental/molecular changes.
METHODS: This article reviews the biology and mechanisms of action of lncRNAs
underlying their potential role in CNS and in some neurodegenerative diseases.
RESULTS: an increasing number of studies report on lncRNAs involvement in
different molecular mechanisms of gene expression modulation in CNS, from neural 
stem cell differentiation mainly by chromatin remodeling, to control of neuronal 
activities. More recently, lncRNAs have been implicated in neurodegenerative
diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease, where the role of BACE1-AS lncRNA has
been widely defined. BACE1-AS levels are up-regulated in AD brains where BACE1-AS
acts by stabilizing BACE1 mRNA thereby increasing BACE1 protein content and Aβ42 
formation. In Frontotemporal dementia and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis the
lncRNAs NEAT1_2 and MALAT1 co-localize at nuclear paraspeckles with TDP-43 and
FUS proteins and their binding to TDP-43 is markedly increased in affected
brains. In Parkinson's Disease the lncRNA UCHL1-AS1 acts by directly promoting
translation of UCHL1 protein leading to perturbation of the ubiquitin-proteasome 
system. Different lncRNAs, such as HTT-AS, BDNF-AS and HAR1, were found to be
dysregulated in their expression also in Huntington's Disease. In Fragile X
syndrome (FXS) and Fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) patients, the
presence of CGG repeats expansion alters the expression of the lncRNAs FMR1-AS1
and FMR6. Interestingly, they are expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes,
suggesting these lncRNAs may represent biomarkers for FXS/FXTAS early detection
and therapy. Finally, the identification of the antisense RNAs SCAANT1-AS and
ATXN8OS in spinocerebellar ataxia 7 and 8, respectively, suggests that very
different mechanisms of action driven by lncRNAs may trigger neurodegeneration in
these disorders. The emerging role of lncRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases
suggests that their dysregulation could trigger neuronal death via still
unexplored RNA-based regulatory mechanisms which deserve further investigation.
The evaluation of their diagnostic significance and therapeutic potential could
also address the setting up of novel treatments in diseases where no cure is
available to date.

Functional conservation of the lncRNA NEAT1 in the ancestrally diverged marsupial

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widely expressed and play various roles in
cell homeostasis. However, because of their low conservation at the sequence
level, recapitulating lncRNA evolutionary history is often challenging. While
performing an ultrastructural analysis of viral particles present in uterine
glands of gestating opossum females, we serendipitously noticed the presence of
numerous structures similar to paraspeckles, nuclear bodies which in human and
mouse cells are assembled around an architectural NEAT1/MENϵ/β lncRNA. Here,
using an opossum kidney (OK) cell line, we confirmed by immuno-electron
microscopy the presence of paraspeckles in marsupials. We then identified the
orthologous opossum NEAT1 gene which, although poorly conserved at the sequence
level, displays NEAT1 characteristic features such as short and long isoforms
expressed from a unique promoter and for the latter an RNase P cleavage site at
its 3'-end. Combining tissue-specific qRT-PCR, in situ hybridization at the
optical and electron microscopic levels, we show that (i) NEAT1 is
paraspeckle-associated in opossum (ii) NEAT1 expression is strongly induced in
late gestation in uterine/placental extracts (iii) NEAT1 induction occurs in the 
uterine gland nuclei in which paraspeckles were detected. Finally, treatment of
OK cells with proteasome inhibitors induces paraspeckle assembly, as previously
observed in human cells. Altogether, these results demonstrate that paraspeckles 
are tissue-specific, stress-responding nuclear bodies in marsupials, illustrating
their structural and functional continuity over 200 My of evolution throughout
the mammalian lineage. In contrast, the rapid evolution of the NEAT1 transcripts 
highlights the relaxed constraint that, despite functional conservation, is
exerted on this lncRNA.

BACKGROUND: Glioma remains a diagnostic challenge because of its variable
clinical presentation and a lack of reliable screening tools. Long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNAs) regulate gene function in a wide range of pathophysiological processes 
and are therefore emerging biomarkers for prostate cancer, hepatic cancer, and
other tumor diseases. However, the effective use of lncRNAs as biomarkers for the
diagnosis of glioma remains unproven.
METHODS: This study included 42 glioma patients and 10 healthy controls. lncRNA
and mRNA microarray chips were used to identify dysregulated lncRNAs in tumor
tissue and tumor-adjacent normal tissue, and SYBR Green-based miRNA quantitative 
real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions were used to validate 
upregulated lncRNAs. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was
conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the lncRNA identified as the
candidate biomarker.
RESULTS: miR210HG levels were significantly higher in tumor tissue than in
tumor-adjacent normal tissue in participating glioma patients. Serum miR210HG
levels were also significantly higher in glioma patients than in healthy
controls. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that serum miR210HG 
was a specific diagnostic predictor of acute pulmonary embolism with an area
under the curve of 0.8323 (95% confidence interval, 0.7347 to 0.9299, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that miR210HG could be an important biomarker
for the diagnosis of glioma, and, as such, large-scale investigations are
urgently needed to pave the way from basic research to clinical use.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein coding RNAs regulating gene
expression. Although for some lncRNAs a relevant role in hypoxic endothelium has 
been shown, the regulation and function of lncRNAs is still largely unknown in
the vascular physio-pathology. Taking advantage of next-generation sequencing
techniques, transcriptomic changes induced by endothelial cell exposure to
hypoxia were investigated. Paired-end sequencing of polyadenylated RNA derived
from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to 1% O2 or normoxia
was performed. Bioinformatics analysis identified ≈2000 differentially expressed 
genes, including 122 lncRNAs. Extensive validation was performed by both
microarray and qPCR. Among the validated lncRNAs, H19, MIR210HG, MEG9, MALAT1 and
MIR22HG were also induced in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia. To test the
functional relevance of lncRNAs in endothelial cells, knockdown of H19 expression
was performed. H19 inhibition decreased HUVEC growth, inducing their accumulation
in G1 phase of the cell cycle; accordingly, p21 (CDKN1A) expression was
increased. Additionally, H19 knockdown also diminished HUVEC ability to form
capillary like structures when plated on matrigel. In conclusion, a
high-confidence signature of lncRNAs modulated by hypoxia in HUVEC was identified

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key species-specific regulators of 
cellular and disease processes. To identify potential lncRNAs relevant to acute
and chronic renal epithelial injury, we performed unbiased whole transcriptome
profiling of human proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) in hypoxic and
inflammatory conditions. RNA sequencing revealed that the protein-coding and
noncoding transcriptomic landscape differed between hypoxia-stimulated and
cytokine-stimulated human PTECs. Hypoxia- and inflammation-modulated lncRNAs were
prioritized for focused followup according to their degree of induction by these 
stress stimuli, their expression in human kidney tissue, and whether exposure of 
human PTECs to plasma of critically ill sepsis patients with acute kidney injury 
modulated their expression. For three lncRNAs (MIR210HG, linc-ATP13A4-8, and
linc-KIAA1737-2) that fulfilled our criteria, we validated their expression
patterns, examined their loci for conservation and synteny, and defined their
associated epigenetic marks. The lncRNA landscape characterized here provides
insights into novel transcriptomic variations in the renal epithelial cell
response to hypoxic and inflammatory stress.

Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an inherited human disease of unknown etiology
associated with neurologic degeneration, immune dysfunction, cancer risk, and
genetic instability. A-T cells are sensitive to ionizing radiation and
radiomimetic drugs, offering the possibility of cloning A-T genes by phenotypic
complementation. We have used this sensitivity to isolate the first human cDNAs
reported to complement A-T cells in culture. Complementation group D A-T
fibroblasts were transfected with an episomal vector-based human cDNA library,
approximately 610,000 resultant transformants were treated with the radiomimetic 
drug streptonigrin-resistant, and nine unrelated cDNAs were recovered from 29
surviving streptonigrin-resistant clones. Five cDNAs were mapped, but none
localized to 11q23, the site of A-T complementation group A and C loci. Four of
the mapped cDNAs conferred mutagen resistance to A-T D fibroblasts on secondary
transfection. One cDNA was identified as a fragment of dek, a gene involved in
acute myeloid leukemia. The dek cDNA fragment and pCAT4.5, a 4.5-kb cDNA that
mapped to 17p11, independently complemented three different phenotypic
abnormalities of A-T D fibroblasts (mutagen sensitivity, hyper-recombination, and
radio-resistant DNA synthesis). The pCAT4.5 cDNA did not complement the mutagen
sensitivity of an A-T group C fibroblast line, suggesting that it represents a
candidate disease gene for group D A-T. Our results indicate that phenotypic
complementation alone is insufficient evidence to prove that a candidate cDNA is 
an A-T disease gene. The complementing cDNAs may represent previously
uncharacterized genes that function in the same pathway as does the A-T gene
product(s) in the regulation of cellular responses to DNA damage.

Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is suggested to function as a long non-coding 
RNA (lncRNA) and to play roles in various human cancers. However, the functional 
properties of MEG3 in ischemic stroke remain unknown. Here, we report that
expression of MEG3 is upregulated following ischemia in adult mice. Moreover,
cerebral ischemia recruits p53 into the MEG3 complex in ischemic tissues. MEG3
directly binds with the p53 DNA binding domain (DBD) consisting of amino acids
271-282 (p53-DBD(271)(-)(282)), which stimulates p53-mediated transactivation and
mediates ischemic neuronal death. Administration of the membrane-permeable
peptide inhibitor Tat-p53-DBD(271)(-)(282) uncouples p53 from MEG3 in vivo and
protects against cerebral ischemic insults in vitro and in vivo. Our data
demonstrate that MEG3 functions as a cell death promoter in ischemia and
physically and functionally interacts with p53 to mediate ischemic damage.
Intervention in the MEG3-p53 interaction presents a new target for the
therapeutic treatment of ischemic insults.

Researchers have recently demonstrated the key role of long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) in regulating embryogenesis and gene expression. However, the exact
mechanism used by lncRNAs in carcinogenesis is still unclear. In particular,
studies regarding the role of lncRNAs in vulvar squamous cell carcinomas (VSCCs) 
are limited. Using microarray analysis, the genome-wide expression profile of
lncRNAs was investigated in four paired VSCCs and adjacent normal vulvar tissues.
Accordingly, several novel lncRNA candidates (HOAIR, MALAT1, MEG3, NEAT1, MIR31HG
and LINC00478) were chosen for further study and real-time reverse transcription 
PCR (RT-PCR) was used to confirm the expression levels among 35 tissue samples. A
panel of dysregulated lncRNAs (MEG3 and MALAT1) were also identified as potential
biomarkers as they also correlated with VSCC carcinogenesis. In summary, the
results revealed that aberrantly expressed lncRNAs may be a factor in VSCC
pathogenesis, potentially providing new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for
VSCC.

In our previous whole-transcriptome sequencing analysis, down-regulation of a
long non-coding RNA, Maternally Expressed Gene 3 (MEG3), was identified in NPC
samples. This finding suggests the possible role of MEG3 as a tumor suppressor in
this distinctive disease. In the present study, two MEG3 variants, AF119863
(MEG3-AF) and BX247998 (MEG3-BX), were found abundantly expressed in a normal
nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line, NP69. Significant down-regulation of MEG3-AF
was further verified in a panel of NPC samples including xenografts and primary
biopsies. MEG3 is an imprinted gene located within chromosome 14q32, a common
deleted region in NPC. Both DNA copy number loss and aberrant promoter
methylation contributed to MEG3 inactivation. Interestingly, MEG3 expression
could successfully be rescued by the treatment of a demethylation agent. Besides,
ectopic expression of MEG3 in NPC cell lines resulted in considerable repression 
of in vitro anchorage-independent growth and in vivo tumorigenicity, in addition 
to significant inhibition in cell proliferation, colony formation and induction
of cell cycle arrest. Finally, we revealed the association between MEG3 activity 
and the p53 signaling cascade. Our findings characterize MEG3 as a tumor
suppressive long non-coding RNA in NPC and encourage the development of precise
long non-coding RNA-targeted epigenetic therapy against this malignancy. This

OBJECTIVE: We present molecular cytogenetic characterization of a prenatally
detected derivative chromosome 9 [der(9)] of unknown origin.
CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old woman underwent amniocentesis at 18 weeks of gestation
because of advanced maternal age, which revealed a der(9) chromosome of unknown
origin. The parental karyotypes were normal. Array comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH) analysis revealed a 2.593 Mb deletion of 9p24.3-p24.2
encompassing DOCK8, KANK1, DMRT1, and VLDLR and a 16.65 Mb duplication of
14q32.11-q32.33 encompassing DLK1, RTL1, MEG3, RTL1as, and MEG8. Quantitative
fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) analysis using D9S937 (9p24.2) and
D14S605 (14q32.2) showed a paternal origin of 9p24.2 deletion and a paternal
origin of 14q32.2 duplication consistent with a paternal origin of the de novo
aberrant chromosome of der(9)t(9p;14q). The fetal karyotype was
46,XX,der(9)t(9;14) (p24.2;q32.11). Metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH) analysis using RP11-57K23 (14q32.33), RP11-31F19 (9p24.3), RP11-30O14
(9p21.1), and RP11-1105I14 (14q11.2) confirmed an unbalanced reciprocal
translocation of der(9)t(9p;14q). We discuss 9p deletion syndrome and 14q
duplication syndrome in this case.
CONCLUSION: Molecular cytogenetic techniques such as aCGH, FISH, and QF-PCR are
useful in the determination of the origin and nature of a prenatally detected de 
novo derivative chromosome of unknown origin.

Long noncoding ribonucleic acids maternally expressed gene 3 inhibits lung cancer
tumor progression through downregulation of MYC.

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: Long noncoding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) nowadays emerge as important
biomarkers or potential therapeutic targets discussed in human cancers. Among
them, maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is known to be decreased in a variety of
malignancies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression of MEG3 in forty pairs 
of lung cancer (LC) tissues. Overexpression of MEG3 was carried out, and we
determined its effect on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration evaluated
by cell counting kit-8, flow cytometric, and transwell analysis. Messenger RNA
and protein expression of MYC were determined by qRT-PCR and western blot,
respectively.
RESULTS: The expression of MEG3 was downregulated in LC tissues. Forced
expression of MEG3 led to reduced abilities of cell proliferation and elevated
apoptosis rate. It also slightly inhibited cell migration capacity in vitro. In
addition, MYC was inhibited by MEG3 overexpression at both transcriptional and
translational levels.
CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed MEG3 could regulate LC progression and serve as
an important target for LC treatment.

DNA methylation is important for gene expression and genome stability, and its
disruption is thought to play a key role in the initiation and progression of
cancer and other diseases. The DLK1-DIO3 cluster has been shown to be imprinted
in humans, and some of its components are relevant to diverse pathological
processes. The purpose of this study was to assess the methylation patterns of
the DLK1-DIO3 cluster in patients with lung cancer to study its relevance in the 
pathogenesis of this disease. We found a characteristic methylation pattern of
this cluster in smoking associated lung cancer, as compared to normal lung
tissue. This methylation profile is not patent however in lung cancer of never
smokers nor in lung tissue of COPD patients. We found 3 deregulated
protein-coding genes at this locus: one was hypermethylated (DIO3) and two were
hypomethylated (DLK1 and RTL1). Statistically significant differences were also
detected in two different families of SNORDs, two miRNA clusters and four lncRNAs
(MEG3, MEG8, MEG9 and LINC00524). These findings were validated using data from
the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database. We have then showed an inverse
correlation between DNA methylation and expression levels in 5 randomly selected 
genes. Several targets of miRNAs included in the DLK1-DIO3 cluster have been
experimentally verified as tumor suppressors. All of these results suggest that
the dysmethylation of the imprinted DLK1-DIO3 cluster could have a relevant role 
in the pathogenesis of lung cancer in current and former smokers and may be used 
for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in diverse biological
processes. Although downregulation of lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3)
has been identified in several types of cancers, little is known concerning its
biological role and regulatory mechanism in hepatoma. Our previous studies
demonstrated that MEG3 induces apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. The aim of
the present study was to determine whether endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is
involved in MEG3‑induced apoptosis. Recombinant lentiviral vectors containing
MEG3 (Lv‑MEG3) were constructed and transfected into HepG2 cells. A
3‑(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, RT‑PCR,
flow cytometry, western blot analysis, immunofluorescence and
immunohistochemistry were applied. Transfected HepG2 cells were also transplanted
into nude mice, and the tumor growth curves were determined. The results showed
that the recombinant lentivirus of MEG3 was transfected successfully into the
HepG2 cells and the expression level of MEG3 was significantly increased. Ectopic
expression of MEG3 inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and
also induced apoptosis. Ectopic expression of MEG3 increased ER stress‑related
proteins 78‑kDa glucose‑regulated protein (GRP78), inositol‑requiring
enzyme 1 (IRE1), RNA‑dependent protein kinase‑like ER kinase (PERK), activating
transcription factor 6 (ATF6), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), caspase‑3,
as well as p53 and NF‑κB expression accompanied by NF‑κB translocation from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus. Furthermore, inhibition of NF‑κB with Bay11‑7082
decreased p53 expression in the MEG3‑transfected cells. These results indicate
that MEG3 inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, partially via the
activation of the ER stress and p53 pathway, in which NF‑κB signaling is required
for p53 activation in ER stress.

In approximately 20% of individuals with Kagami-Ogata syndrome (KOS14, MIM
608149), characterized by a bell-shaped thorax with coat-hanger configuration of 
the ribs, joint contractures, abdominal wall defects and polyhydramnios during
the pregnancy, the syndrome is caused by a maternal deletion of the imprinted
gene cluster in chromosome 14q32.2. Most deletions reported so far included one
or both of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) - DLK1/MEG3 IG-DMR and
MEG3-DMR. We present two unrelated families with two affected siblings each,
presenting with classical KOS14 due to maternally inherited microdeletions.
Interestingly, all four patients have lived through to adulthood, even though
mortality rates for patients with KOS14 due to a microdeletion are relatively
high. In the first family, none of the DMRs is included in the deletion and the
methylation status is identical to that of controls. Deletions that do not
encompass the DMRs in this region are thus sufficient to elicit the full KOS14
phenotype. In the second family, a partially overlapping deletion including both 
DMRs and MEG3 was detected. In summary, we show that patients with KOS14 can live
into adulthood, that causal deletions do not have to include the DMRs and that
consequently a normal methylation pattern does not exclude KOS14.European Journal

Long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with various biological roles such 
as embryogenesis, stem cell biology, cellular development and present specific
tissue expression profiles. Aberrant expression of lncRNAs are thought to play a 
critical role in the progression and development of various cancer types,
including gliomas. Glioblastomas (GBM) are common and malignant primary brain
tumours. Brain cancer stem cells (BCSC) are isolated from both low and high-grade
tumours in adults and children, by cell fraction which express neuronal stem cell
surface marker CD133. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression
profiles of lncRNAs in brain tumour cells and determine its potential biological 
function. For this purpose, U118MG-U87MG; GBM stem cell series were used. Human
parental brain cancer cells were included as the control group; the expressions
of disease related human lncRNA profiles were studied by LightCycler 480
real-time PCR. Expression profiles of 83 lncRNA genes were analyzed for a
significant dysregulation, compared to the control cells. Among lncRNAs, 51
lncRNA genes down-regulated, while 8 lncRNA genes were up-regulated. PCAT-1
(-2.36), MEG3 (-5.34), HOTAIR (-2.48) lncRNAs showed low expression in
glioblastoma compared to the human (parental) brain cancer stem cells, indicating
their role as tumour suppressor genes on gliomas. As a result, significant
changes for anti-cancer gene expressions were detected with disease-related human
lncRNA array plates. Identification of novel target genes may lead to promising
developments in human brain cancer treatment.

AIM: This study aimed to select several signature genes associated with bladder
cancer, thus to investigate the possible mechanism in bladder cancer.
METHODS: The mRNA expression profile data of GSE31614, including ten bladder
tissues and ten control samples, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus.
The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in bladder cancer samples compared with
the control samples were screened using the Student's t-test method. Functional
analysis for the DEGs was analyzed using the Database for Annotation,
Visualization, and Integrated Discovery from the Gene Ontology database, followed
by the transcription function annotation of DEGs from Tumor-Associated Gene
database. Motifs of genes that had transcription functions in promoter region
were analyzed using the Seqpos.
RESULTS: A total of 1,571 upregulated and 1,507 downregulated DEGs in the bladder
cancer samples were screened. ELF3 and MYBL2 involved in cell cycle and DNA
replication were tumor suppressors. MEG3, APEX1, and EZH2 were related with the
cell epigenetic regulation in bladder cancer. Moreover, HOXB9 and EN1 that have
their own motif were the transcription factors.
CONCLUSION: Our study has identified several key genes involved in bladder
cancer. ELF3 and MYBL2 are tumor suppressers, HOXB9 and EN1 are the main
regulators, while MEG3, APEX1, and EZH2 are driving factors for bladder cancer
progression.

We report on the characterization of a de novo, apparently balanced translocation
t(X;15)(p11.3;q26) detected in a girl with multiple congenital malformations.
Replication banding studies on Epstein-Barr virus transformed peripheral blood
lymphocytes revealed non-random X chromosome inactivation with predominant
inactivation of the derivative X chromosome. Using chromosomal fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH), we located the breakpoints to a 30 kb region on the
short arm of the X chromosome band p11.3 and to a 160 kb region defined by BAC
RP11-89K11 on the long arm of chromosome 15. Our data suggest that the
disruption/disturbance of plant homeo domain (PHD) zinc finger gene KIAA0215 or
of another gene (RGN, RNU12, P17.3, or RBM10) in the breakpoint region on the X
chromosome is not well tolerated and leads to the selection of cells with an
active non-rearranged X chromosome.

We previously identified TDRG1 (testis developmental related gene 1), a novel
gene with exclusive expression in testis, promoted the proliferation and
progression of cultured human seminoma cells through PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. As 
increasing evidence reveal that aberrant activation of this signaling is involved
in cisplatin resistance. Then, in this study, we further explored whether TDRG1
regulated the chemosensitivity of seminoma TCam-2 cells to cisplatin. Our
researches showed TDRG1 could regulate the viability of TCam-2 cells following
cisplatin treatment in vitro through control of both cell apoptosis and cell
cycle. Mechanistically, we observed TDRG1 positively regulated the expression
levels of the key elements in PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway including p-PI3K, p-Akt and
p-mTOR and also affected the translocation of nuclear p-Akt in TCam-2 cells
during cisplatin treatment. Meanwhile, the levels of Bad, cytochrome c, caspase-9
ratio (activated/total), caspase-3 ratio (activated/total) and cleaved-PARP were 
negatively modulated by TDRG1, which meant the involvement of
mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, we found the effect of
TDRG1 knockdown or TDRG1 overexpression could be reversed by IGF-1, a PI3K
signaling activator, or LY294002, a inhibitor of this pathway, respectively.
Similar effects of TDRG1 on cisplatin chemosensitivity and associated molecular
mechanism were also confirmed in vivo by employing xenograft assays. In addition,
the positive correlation between TDRG1 and p-PI3K, or p-Akt, was found in tumor
tissues from seminoma patients. In conclusion, we uncover that TDRG1 regulates
chemosensitivity of TCam-2 cells to cisplatin through PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and
mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway both in vitro and in vivo.

Human testis development-related gene 1 (TDRG1) is a recently identified gene
that is expressed exclusively in the testes and promotes the development of
testicular germ cell tumors. In this study, the role of TDRG1 in the development 
of testicular seminoma, which is the most common testicular germ cell tumor, was 
further investigated. Based on polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and
immunohistochemistry tests, both gene and protein expression levels of TDRG1 were
significantly upregulated in testicular seminoma tissues compared with normal
testicular tissues. Additionally, the levels of phosphoinositide-3 kinase
(PI3K)/p110 and Akt phosphorylation were dramatically upregulated in testicular
seminoma tissues. Accordingly, in our cell experiment, seminoma TCam-2 cells were
subjected to different treatments: the TDRG1 knockout, TDRG1 overexpression, PI3K
inhibition (LY294002 administration), or PI3K activation (insulin-like growth
factor-1 administration). Cell proliferation, the proliferation index, apoptosis 
rate, cell adhesive capacity, and cell invasion capability were assessed. Cells
with both TDRG1 knockout and PI3K inhibition exhibited decreased cell
proliferation, proliferation indexes, cell adhesion capacity, and cell invasion
capability and increased apoptosis rates. Most of these effects were reversed by 
TDRG1 overexpression or PI3K activation, indicating that both TDRG1- and
PI3K-mediated signaling promote proliferation and invasion of testicular seminoma
cells. The knockout of TDRG1 significantly decreased the phosphorylation levels
of PI3K/p85, PI3K/p110, Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; Ser(2448)).
Except for PI3K/p110, TDRG1 overexpression had the opposite effects on
phosphorylation levels. Phosphorylated mTOR at Ser(2481) and Thr(2446) was not
affected by TDRG1 or PI3K in our tests. Thus, these results indicate that TDRG1
promotes the development and migration of seminoma cells via the regulation of
the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway; this contributes to an understanding of the 
precise mechanisms underlying the development and migration of seminomas and lays
a theoretical foundation for the development of appropriate therapies.

growth factor 1.

Aplastic anemia (AA) is rare disease that is predominantly observed in
adolescents. Without effective management at an early stage, is associated with a
high risk of mortality. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can
differentiate into various types of cell, which are able to produce a number of
hematopoietic growth factors considered to be important in AA alleviation.
However, the mechanism underlying the role of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1)
in BMSC differentiation remains unknown. In the current study, the investigation 
focused on the regulatory role and potential signaling pathway of FGF1 in BMSC
differentiation in patients exhibiting AA. BMSCs were infected with Ad‑FGF1 and
presented a potent proliferation capability, which was evaluated using Cell
Counting kit‑8 analysis. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain
reaction revealed that long non‑coding (lnc)RNA of testis development related
gene 1 (TDRG1) was significantly upregulated, demonstrating high expression at
the transcriptional level in the BMSCs that were infected with Ad‑FGF1. The
decreased proliferation capability of BMSCs that were treated with Ad‑FGF1 and
TDRG1‑small interfering RNA validated the vital effect of TDRG1 on the FGF1
regulatory process of BMSC differentiation. Further experiments revealed that the
increase of acetyl‑histones, H3 and H4 was diminished in the TDRG1 promoter of
BMSCs that were infected with Ad‑FGF1, which indicated that the process of
acetylation was promoted when the BMSCs were infected with Ad-FGF1. Thus, it was 
inferred that FGF1 induces the proliferation of BMSCs in patients with AA via
promoting acetylation in lncRNA of the TDRG1 gene promoter.

Testis developmental related gene 1 (TDRG1) is a novel human testis-specific
gene. TDRG1 is differentially expressed in cancerous tissue compared with normal 
testicular tissue and demonstrates a unique expression pattern in normal testes; 
therefore, this gene may be involved in the occurrence and development of
testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT). In the present study, the expression level of
TDRG1 was downregulated in human TGCT NTERA-2 cells by RNA interference (RNAi) in
order to investigate the association between TDRG1 and TGCT. The TDRG1 mRNA and
protein expression levels in NTERA-2 cells were significantly inhibited following
transfection with specific RNAi plasmids. The ability to proliferate (inhibited
by 15.4% at day 3 and 26.1% at day 5; P<0.001) and invade (reduced by 49.1%;
P=0.01) in vitro was suppressed in cells in which the expression level of TDRG1
was reduced, and a corresponding increase in the apoptotic potential was observed
(the early apoptotic potential and total apoptotic potential were increased by
75%; P=0.019 and 54.8%; P=0.009, respectively). The results of the present study 
indicated that the biological behavior of NTERA-2 cells is associated with TDRG1 
expression levels, and that this gene may be a novel target candidate in the
treatment of TGCT.

Testis-specific proteins, synthesized during spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis, 
are necessary for spermatid differentiation and/or for mature sperm function
during fertilization. However, majority of these genes have neither been
identified nor fully characterized. Testis developmental related gene 1 (TDRG1), 
a newly identified human testis-specific gene, encodes a 100-amino-acid protein
without any characterized protein domains, and it may play a role in
spermatogenesis. However, whether this human-specific protein is important for
mature sperm function remains unclear. As an initial effort, in this study, we
aimed to systematically investigate the expression and localization of TDRG1 in
normal human spermatozoa. Thus, immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the
distribution of TDRG1 in human testis. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction, western blot analysis and indirect immunofluorescence were used to
determine the expression and localization of TDRG1 in normal human spermatozoa.
The immunohistochemistry results showed that the TDRG1 protein was expressed in
spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules of human testis. Interestingly,
the TDRG1 was more abundant in spermatogenic cells at the late stages of
spermatogenesis. The TDRG1 antibody specifically recognized an 11-kDa protein
only in soluble extracts from normal human spermatozoa. Indirect
immunofluorescence assays indicated that TDRG1 located in the midpiece, principal
piece and flagellum of normal human spermatozoa. In conclusion, TDRG1 was found
not only in spermatogonia, but also in spermatozoa. The localization of TDRG1 in 
human normal spermatozoa implies its potential regulatory role in sperm motility.

Spermatogenesis is a highly coordinated physiological process that requires the
correct expression and functions of thousands of developmentally regulated genes.
The regulation of spermatogenesis is not well defined, since majority of the
related genes have neither been identified nor fully characterized. Hence, it is 
meaningful to identify and characterize these genes to reveal the mechanism
underlying spermatogenesis. In this study, using digital differential display, we
identified a novel human testis-specific gene, testis developmental related gene 
1 (TDRG1, GenBank DQ168992), via electronic subtraction of human testis UniGene
databases from those of non-reproductive tissues. The transcript of the TDRG1
gene has an open-reading frame that encodes 100 amino acids. We next prepared the
anti-TDRG1 monoclonal antibody 10B6 and confirmed that it specifically recognizes
an 11-kDa protein in the tissue extracts from an adult human testicular sample
(age 31 years) by Western blot analysis. RT-PCR coupled with immunohistochemistry
of human tissues demonstrated that TDRG1 is exclusively expressed in the testis
but not in any other non-reproductive tissues. TDRG1 is mainly located in
spermatogenic cells in seminiferous tubules of adult testis. Furthermore, TDRG1
shows the highest expression level in human post-puberty testis, with the
expression levels decreasing afterwards with aging. Importantly, TDRG1 mRNA is
undetectable in the fetal testis, as judged by RT-PCR. In conclusion, TDRG1 is a 
developmentally regulated testicular-specific gene. We suggest that TDRG1, a
newly identified testis-specific gene, may play important roles in human
spermatogenesis.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protein expression of human testis development
related gene 1 (TDRG1) in human testicular cancer and its pathological
significance.
METHODS: The expression levels of TDRG1 were detected in the testis tissues of
testicular cancer patients and normal men by tissue microarray and
immunohistochemistry, and the results were analyzed.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry exhibited positive expression of the TDRG1 protein 
in the testis of 73.3% (11/15) of the normal men, 83.3% (10/12) of the patients
with embryonal carcinoma, 80.0% (8/10) of those with yolk sac tumor, 26.9% (7/26)
of those with seminoma, and 57.1% (4/7) of those with teratoma. The expression
levels of TDRG1 in the testis tissues of the seminoma and teratoma groups were
shown to be significantly lower than that of the normal control (P < 0.01 and P <
0.05), but those of the embryonal carcinoma and yolk sac tumor groups exhibited
no significant differences from that of the latter (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The significantly reduced expression of the TDRG1 protein in patients
with seminoma or teratoma indicates that TDRG1 may be a candidate cancer
suppressor gene.

OBJECTIVE: To construct a prokaryotic plasmid to express the testis development
related gene 1 (TDRG1) recombinant protein and obtain anti-TDRG1 mAb by
immunizing mice, and to identify the biological properties of the mAb.
METHODS: The coding sequence of TDRG1 was amplified by RT-PCR from normal human
testis tissue and cloned into the vector pET21, and then was expressed in the E. 
coli BL 21(DE3) to get TDRG1 recombinant protein. The purified TDRG1 recombinant 
protein was injected to immunize the BALB/C mice to develop anti-TDRG1 mAb.
Splenocytes of the immunized mice were collected and fused with the mouse myeloma
cell line Sp2/0 cells. The hybridoma cells that secreted anti-TDRG1 mAb were
subcloned with limited dilution. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was
used to evaluate titers and subtypes of mAb. Western blot and
immunohistochemistry were used to detect specificity of mAb.
RESULTS: The prokaryotic plasmid expressing the recombinant protein was
constructed, and the TDRG1 recombinant protein was expressed and purified. Two
hybridoma cell lines that secreted anti-TDRG1 mAb were obtained. The titer of the
mAb in ascites was 1 : 1.6 x 10(6), and the subtype of the mAb was IgG(1). Westem
blot and immunohistochemistry analysis indicated the mAb showed specific
combination with TDRG1 protein in human testes.
CONCLUSION: The TDRG1 recombinant protein is highly purified and has strong
antigenicity. The anti-TDRG1 mAb is produced successfully.

OBJECTIVE: To clone a novel human testis-specific gene TDRG1.
METHODS: A new contig of expression sequence tags (ESTs) Hs.180197 was identified
from the testis libraries using digital differential display (DDD) to screen the 
novel human testis-specific gene. To validate the use of bioinformatics
approaches in gene discovery, the ESTs Hs.180197, which was predicted to be
testis specific, was chosen for further study. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on different normal tissues to identify the
expression of Hs.180197 in human testis. Using bioinformatics methods and IMAGE
cloning of this contig, the full-length cDNA sequence of the noval human gene was
cloned.
RESULTS: This novel gene was 1197 bp in length, located in chromosome
6p21.1-p21.2. The sequence of the open reading frame was 504-806 bp, as confirmed
by RT-PCR and sequencing in human testis. The cDNA encodes a novel protein of 100
amino acids with a theoretical molecular weight of 10 000 and isoelectric point
of 6.81. The sequence shares no significant homology with any known protein in
the databases. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of multiple tissues further
showed that the novel gene was expressed specifically in adult human testis.
Considering a possible relation of this novel gene with the function of human
testis, we named this new gene TDRG1 (testis development related gene 1, GenBank 
accession number: DQ168992).
CONCLUSION: DDD combined with laboratory validation is an efficient method for
identifying new human functional genes.

Immortality is an essential characteristic of human carcinoma cells. We recently 
developed an efficient, reproducible method that immortalizes human mammary
epithelial cells (HMEC) in the absence of gross genomic changes by targeting 2
critical senescence barriers. Consistent transcriptomic changes associated with
immortality were identified using microarray analysis of isogenic normal finite
pre-stasis, abnormal finite post-stasis, and immortal HMECs from 4 individuals. A
total of 277 genes consistently changed in cells that transitioned from
post-stasis to immortal. Gene ontology analysis of affected genes revealed
biological processes significantly altered in the immortalization process. These 
immortalization-associated changes showed striking similarity to the gene
expression changes seen in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) clinical breast cancer 
data. The most dramatic change in gene expression seen during the immortalization
step was the downregulation of an unnamed, incompletely annotated transcript that
we called MORT, for mortality, since its expression was closely associated with
the mortal, finite lifespan phenotype. We show here that MORT (ZNF667-AS1) is
expressed in all normal finite lifespan human cells examined to date and is lost 
in immortalized HMEC. MORT gene silencing at the mortal/immortal boundary was due
to DNA hypermethylation of its CpG island promoter. This epigenetic silencing is 
also seen in human breast cancer cell lines and in a majority of human breast
tumor tissues. The functional importance of DNA hypermethylation in MORT gene
silencing is supported by the ability of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine to reactivate
MORT expression. Analysis of TCGA data revealed deregulation of MORT expression
due to DNA hypermethylation in 15 out of the 17 most common human cancers. The
epigenetic silencing of MORT in a large majority of the common human cancers
suggests a potential fundamental role in cellular immortalization during human
carcinogenesis.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive type of breast cancer with 
high heterogeneity. To date, there is no efficient therapy for TNBC patients and 
the prognosis is poor. It is urgent to find new biomarkers for the diagnosis of
TNBC or efficient therapy targets. As an area of focus in the post-genome period,
long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to play critical roles in many
cancers, including TNBC. However, there is little information on differentially
expressed lncRNAs between TNBC and non-TNBC. We detected the expression levels of
lncRNAs in TNBC and non-TNBC tissues separately. Then we analyzed the lncRNA
expression signature of TNBC relative to non-TNBC, and found dysregulated lncRNAs
participated in important biological processes though Gene Ontology and Pathway
analysis. Finally, we validated these lncRNA expression levels in breast cancer
tissues and cells, and then confirmed that 4 lncRNAs (RP11-434D9.1, LINC00052,
BC016831, and IGKV) were correlated with TNBC occurrence through receiver
operating characteristic curve analysis. This study offers helpful information to
understand the initiation and development mechanisms of TNBC comprehensively and 
suggests potential biomarkers for diagnosis or therapy targets for clinical
treatment.

Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by the deletion of 
imprinted genes on the paternally inherited human chromosome 15q11-q13. This
locus harbours a long non-protein-coding RNA (U-UBE3A-ATS) that contains six
intron-encoded snoRNAs, including the SNORD116 and SNORD115 repetitive clusters. 
The 3'-region of U-UBE3A-ATS is transcribed in the cis-antisense direction to the
ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene. Deletion of the SNORD116 region causes
key characteristics of PWS. There are few indications that SNORD115 might
regulate serotonin receptor (5HT2C) pre-mRNA processing. Here we performed
quantitative real-time expression analyses of RNAs from the PWS locus across 20
human tissues and combined it with deep-sequencing data derived from Cap Analysis
of Gene Expression (CAGE-seq) libraries. We found that the expression profiles of
SNORD64, SNORD107, SNORD108 and SNORD116 are similar across analyzed tissues and 
correlate well with SNORD116 embedded U-UBE3A-ATS exons (IPW116). Notable
differences in expressions between the aforementioned RNAs and SNORD115 together 
with the host IPW115 and UBE3A cis-antisense exons were observed. CAGE-seq
analysis revealed the presence of potential transcriptional start sites
originated from the U-UBE3A-ATS spanning region. Our findings indicate novel
aspects for the expression regulation in the PWS locus.

Genetic analyses were performed in a male patient with suspected Prader-Willi
syndrome who presented with hypogonadism, excessive eating, central obesity,
small hands and feet and cognition within the low normal range. However, he had
no neonatal hypotonia or feeding problems during infancy. Chromosome analysis
showed a normal male karyotype. Further analysis with array-CGH identified a
mosaic 847 kb deletion in 15q11-q13, including SNURF-SNRPN, the snoRNA gene
clusters SNORD116 (HBII-85), SNORD115, (HBII-52), SNORD109 A and B (HBII-438A and
B), SNORD64 (HBII-13), and NPAP1 (C15ORF2). MLPA confirmed the deletion and the
results were compatible with a paternal origin. Metaphase-FISH verified the
mosaicism with the deletion present in 58% of leukocytes analyzed. Three smaller 
deletions in this region have previously been reported in patients with
Prader-Willi syndrome phenotype. All three deletions included SNORD116, but only 
two encompassed parts of SNURF-SNRPN, implicating SNORD116 as the major
contributor to the Prader-Willi phenotype. Our case adds further information
about genotype-phenotype correlation and supports the hypothesis that SNORD116
plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome. Furthermore, it 
examplifies diagnostic difficulties in atypical cases and illustrates the need
for additional testing methods when Prader-Willi syndrome is suspected.

OBJECTIVE: We have previously reported distinct genetic architectures of renal
impairment in T2D patients of Slavic and Celtic origins participating in the
ADVANCE trial (J Hypertens. 2015 Jun;33 Suppl 1:e3). Further analysis suggests
that the major driver of the difference in the prevalence of T2D complications
between Slavic and Celtic groups is due to an earlier onset of diabetes in Slavic
patients. In an attempt to distinguish between environmental and genetic factors 
on age of onset of diabetes, we have determined the age of onset of T2D in Slavic
subjects living in Celtic countries and confirmed the same earlier onset (-2
years) in these subjects, notwithstanding their living environment.
DESIGN AND METHOD: We performed GWAS analyses of age of onset of T2D in 3500 T2D 
patients from ADVANCE trial. Analyses were done for Celtic and Slavic groups
separately and combined.
RESULTS: 7 loci are associated to age of onset of T2D in patients of both Celtic 
and Slavic origins, including HDAC9 gene (rs1128745). 9 loci are selectively
associated to this phenotype in patients of Celtic origin, including the Il23R
(rs1273974) while 9 different loci are associated to it in Slavic patients only. 
Among the latter, PROX1/PROX1-AS1 genes (rs340841) has the highest effect size.
SNP rs 340841 homozygous CC genotype is associated with 2 years earlier onset of 
T2D in Slavic patients living in Slavic countries or in Celtic countries. This
locus is also associated with eGFR decline in Slavic, with macroalbuminuria and
hypertension in all ADVANCE subjects of Caucasian origin and with Interleukin-6
levels at baseline. In recent literature search we found that PROX1 gene has been
associated with abnormalities of glucose metabolism and risk of diabetes with
variations depending on ethnicity.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that fine granularity of distinction in geo-ethic
background assist in resolution of clinically relevant genetic contribution to
cardiovascular complication in T2D.

Osteonecrosis is a dose-limiting toxicity in the treatment of pediatric acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Prior studies on the genetics of osteonecrosis have
focused on patients ≥10 years of age, leaving the genetic risk factors for the
larger group of children <10 years incompletely understood. Here, we perform the 
first evaluation of genetic risk factors for osteonecrosis in children <10 years.
The discovery cohort comprised 82 cases of osteonecrosis and 287 controls treated
on Children's Oncology Group (COG) standard-risk ALL protocol AALL0331
(NCT00103285, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00103285), with results
tested for replication in 817 children <10 years treated on COG protocol AALL0232
(NCT00075725, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00075725). The top
replicated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were near bone morphogenic
protein 7 [BMP7: rs75161997, P = 5.34 × 10(-8) (odds ratio [OR] 15.0) and P =
.0498 (OR 8.44) in the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively] and
PROX1-antisense RNA1 (PROX1-AS1: rs1891059, P = 2.28 × 10(-7) [OR 6.48] and P =
.0077 [OR 3.78] for the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively). The top
replicated nonsynonymous SNP, rs34144324, was in a glutamate receptor gene
(GRID2, P = 8.65 × 10(-6) [OR 3.46] and P = .0136 [OR 10.8] in the discovery and 
replication cohorts, respectively). In a meta-analysis, the BMP7 and PROX1-AS1
variants (rs75161997 and rs1891059, respectively) met the significance threshold 
of <5 × 10(-8). Top replicated SNPs were enriched in enhancers active in
mesenchymal stem cells, and analysis of annotated genes demonstrated enrichment
in glutamate receptor and adipogenesis pathways. These data may provide new
insights into the pathophysiology of osteonecrosis.

Regulation of Emx2 expression by antisense transcripts in murine cortico-cerebral
precursors.

Spigoni G(1), Gedressi C, Mallamaci A.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Emx2 encodes for a transcription factor expressed in the embryonic
intermediate mesoderm and central nervous system (CNS). It is implicated in
several aspects of cerebral cortex development, including morphogenetic field
specification, arealization, precursor proliferation and lamination. Four
Emx2-associated antisense transcripts have been found in the urogenital system;
one of them, Emx2OS, has been also detected in the adult brain. Until now,
however, nothing is known about expression and function of Emx2OS in the
developing CNS.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization,
we reconstructed the Emx2OS expression profile in the embryonic CNS, paying
special attention to the developing cerebral cortex. Emx2OS was observed in a
number of CNS structures expressing also Emx2. Within the cortex, Emx2OS was
detectable in periventricular precursors, expressing the sense transcript, and
peaked in newly born post-mitotic neurons not expressing such transcript. By
integrating lentiviral gene delivery, RNAi, TetON technology, morpholino-mediated
gene knock-down, drug-induced perturbation of gene expression, and quantitative
RT-PCR, we addressed possible roles of Ex2 antisense RNA in Emx2 regulation, in
primary CNS precursor cultures. We found that, in both cortical precursors and
their neuronal progenies, Emx2 antisense RNA contributes to post-transcriptional 
down-regulation of its sense partner, possibly by a Dicer-promoted mechanism. The
same RNA, when delivered to rhombo-spinal precursors, stimulates ectopic
expression of Emx2, whereas Emx2 knock-out dramatically impairs Emx2OS
transcription. This suggests that, within the developing CNS, a reciprocal
Emx2/Emx2OS regulatory loop may normally sustain transcription at the Emx2 locus.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that antisense transcripts may
contribute to developmental regulation of a key transcription factor gene
implicated in CNS patterning, possibly by complex and multilevel mechanisms. The 
activation of Emx2 by a short antisense transcript may be a prototype of a method
for overexpressing single specific genes, without introducing additional copies
of them into the genome.

The homeodomain transcription factor EMX2 is critical for central nervous system 
and urogenital development. In addition, EMX2 maps to a region of allelic
deletion corresponding to a putative endometrial tumor suppressor at 10q26. We
now report another polyadenylated transcript that is transcribed on the strand
opposite to EMX2 and overlaps with the EMX2 transcript. This transcript was
designated EMX2OS (OS, opposite strand), and an orthologous transcript present at
the murine Emx2 locus was designated Emx2os. Alternative splicing to generate
transcripts with varying 5' sequences was detected in the human but not the
mouse. Neither ortholog contains a significant open reading frame, nor is primary
sequence conserved between the two species. The sense and antisense transcripts
display coordinate expression in that EMX2 and EMX2OS are abundant in normal
postmenopausal endometrium, reduced in premenopausal endometrium, and absent or
reduced in a majority of primary endometrial tumors. EMX2, EMX2OS, Emx2, and
Emx2os are abundant in the uterine endometrium, with sense and antisense
transcripts exhibiting identical expression patterns. Conservation of functional 
human and murine EMX2 antisense genes, of overlap between the sense and the
antisense transcripts, and of identical cellular expression patterns suggests a
biological function for EMX2OS, presumably to regulate EMX2.

Researchers have recently demonstrated the key role of long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) in regulating embryogenesis and gene expression. However, the exact
mechanism used by lncRNAs in carcinogenesis is still unclear. In particular,
studies regarding the role of lncRNAs in vulvar squamous cell carcinomas (VSCCs) 
are limited. Using microarray analysis, the genome-wide expression profile of
lncRNAs was investigated in four paired VSCCs and adjacent normal vulvar tissues.
Accordingly, several novel lncRNA candidates (HOAIR, MALAT1, MEG3, NEAT1, MIR31HG
and LINC00478) were chosen for further study and real-time reverse transcription 
PCR (RT-PCR) was used to confirm the expression levels among 35 tissue samples. A
panel of dysregulated lncRNAs (MEG3 and MALAT1) were also identified as potential
biomarkers as they also correlated with VSCC carcinogenesis. In summary, the
results revealed that aberrantly expressed lncRNAs may be a factor in VSCC
pathogenesis, potentially providing new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for
VSCC.

Let-7c, an intronic microRNA (miRNA) embedded in the long non-coding gene
LINC00478, can act as a tumor suppressor by targeting oncogenes. Previous studies
indicated that in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML) bearing the leukemia promoting PML/RARα fusion
protein, let-7c expression seems to be controlled by the host gene promoter, in
which canonical Retinoic Acid Responsive Elements (RAREs) are bound by PML/RARα
in an all transretinoic acid (ATRA)-sensitive manner. Here, let-7c
transcriptional regulation was further investigated and a novel intronic promoter
upstream of the pre-miRNA was identified. This new promoter has transcriptional
activity strongly indicating that at least two promoters need to be considered
for let-7c transcription: the distal host gene and the proximal intronic
promoter. Therefore, epigenetic modifying enzymes and histone acetylation and
methylation status were analyzed on both let-7c promoters. It was demonstrated
that ATRA treatment leads to let-7c upregulation inducing a more open chromatin
conformation of the host gene promoter, with an enrichment of epigenetic marks
that correlate with a more active transcriptional state. Conversely, the
epigenetic marks on the intronic promoter are not significantly affected by ATRA 
treatment. Interestingly, in solid tumors such as prostate and lung
adenocarcinoma it was found that both host and intronic promoters are functional.
These data suggest that while the host gene promoter may control let-7c
expression in AML, in a nonleukemic tumor context instead the intronic promoter
contributes or preferentially regulates let-7c transcription.IMPLICATIONS:

The androgen receptor (AR) stimulates and represses gene expression to promote
the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. Here, we report that androgen 
represses the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster through AR and anti-androgen drugs
block the androgen-repression of the miRNA cluster. AR directly binds to the host
gene of the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster, LINC00478. Expression of the cluster is
repressed or activated by chromatin remodelers EZH2 or JMJD3 in the presence or
absence of androgen, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis reveals a significant 
enrichment of targets of miR-99a, let-7c and miR-125b in androgen-induced gene
sets, suggesting that downregulation of the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster by
androgen protects many of their target mRNAs from degradation and indirectly
assists in the gene induction. We validated the hypothesis with 12 potential
targets of the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster induced by androgen: 9 out of the 12 
mRNAs are downregulated by the microRNA cluster. To ascertain the biological
significance of this hypothesis, we focused on IGF1R, a known prostate cancer
growth factor that is induced by androgen and directly targeted by the
miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster. The androgen-induced cell proliferation is
ameliorated to a similar extent as anti-androgen drugs by preventing the
repression of the microRNAs or induction of IGF1R in androgen-dependent prostate 
cancer cells. Expression of a microRNA-resistant form of IGF1R protects these
cells from inhibition by the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster. These results indicate
that a thorough understanding of how androgen stimulates prostate cancer growth
requires not only an understanding of genes directly induced/repressed by AR, but
also of genes indirectly induced by AR through the repression of key microRNAs.

Biosensors using live cells are analytical devices that have the advantage of
being highly sensitive for their targets. Although attention has primarily
focused on reporter gene assays using functional promoters, cell viability assays
are still efficient. We focus on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are involved
in the molecular mechanisms associated with responses to cellular stresses as a
new biological material. Here we have developed human live cells transfected with
lncRNAs that can be used as an intelligent sensor of cytotoxicity for a broad
range of environmental stresses. We identified three lncRNAs (GAS5, IDI2-AS1, and
SNHG15) that responded to cycloheximide in HEK293 cells. Overexpression of these 
lncRNAs sensitized human cells to cell death in response to various stresses
(cycloheximide, ultraviolet irradiation, mercury II chloride, or hydrogen
peroxide). In particular, dual lncRNA (GAS5 plus IDI2-AS1, or GAS5 plus SNHG15)
overexpression sensitized cells to cell death by more cellular stresses. We
propose a method for highly sensitive biosensors using overexpression of lncRNAs 
that can potentially measure the cytotoxicity signals of various environmental
stresses.

Identification of short-lived long non-coding RNAs as surrogate indicators for
chemical stress response.

Abiotic and biotic stressors in human cells are often a result of sudden and/or
frequent changes in environmental factors. The molecular response to stress
involves elaborate modulation of gene expression and is of homeostatic,
ecological, and evolutionary importance. Although attention has primarily focused
on signaling pathways and protein networks, long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are
increasingly involved in the molecular mechanisms associated with responses to
cellular stresses. We identified six novel short-lived long ncRNAs (MIR22HG,
GABPB-AS1, LINC00152, IDI2-AS1, SNHG15, and FLJ33630) that responded to chemical 
stressors (cisplatin, cycloheximide, and mercury (II) oxide) in HeLa Tet-off
cells. Our results indicate that short-lived long ncRNAs respond to general and
specific chemical stressors. The expression levels of the short-lived long ncRNAs
were elevated because of prolonged decay rates in response to chemical stressors 
and interruption of RNA degradation pathways. We propose that these long ncRNAs
have the potential to be surrogate indicators of cellular stress responses.

Mammalian X-linked gene expression is highly regulated as female cells contain
two and male one X chromosome (X). To adjust the X gene dosage between genders,
female mouse preimplantation embryos undergo an imprinted form of X chromosome
inactivation (iXCI) that requires both Rlim (also known as Rnf12) and the long
non-coding RNA Xist. Moreover, it is thought that gene expression from the single
active X is upregulated to correct for bi-allelic autosomal (A) gene expression. 
We have combined mouse genetics with RNA-seq on single mouse embryos to
investigate functions of Rlim on the temporal regulation of iXCI and Xist. Our
results reveal crucial roles of Rlim for the maintenance of high Xist RNA levels,
Xist clouds and X-silencing in female embryos at blastocyst stages, while initial
Xist expression appears Rlim-independent. We find further that X/A upregulation
is initiated in early male and female preimplantation embryos.

We report on a 16-year-old boy with a maternally inherited ~ 18.3 Mb
Xq13.2-q21.31 duplication delimited by aCGH. As previously described in patients 
with similar duplications, his clinical features included intellectual
disability, developmental delay, speech delay, generalized hypotonia, infantile
feeding difficulties, self-injurious behavior, short stature and endocrine
problems. As additional findings, he presented recurrent seizures and pubertal
gynecomastia. His mother was phenotypically normal and had completely skewed
inactivation of the duplicated X chromosome, as most female carriers of such
duplications. Five previously reported patients with partial Xq duplications
presented duplication breakpoints similar to those of our patient. One of them, a
fetus with multiple congenital abnormalities, had the same cytogenetic
duplication breakpoint. Three of the reported patients shared many features with 
our proband but the other had some clinical features of the Prader-Willi
syndrome. It was suggested that ATRX overexpression could be involved in the
major clinical features of patients with partial Xq duplications. We propose that
this gene could also be involved with the obesity of the patient with the
Prader-Willi-like phenotype. Additionally, we suggest that the PCDH11X gene could
be a candidate for our patient's recurrent seizures. In males, the Xq13-q21
duplication should be considered in the differential diagnosis of Prader-Willi
syndrome, as previously suggested, and neuromuscular diseases, particularly
mitochondriopathies.

The long non-coding RNA X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) mediates the
transcriptional silencing of genes on the X chromosome. Here we show that, in
human cells, XIST is highly methylated with at least 78 N(6)-methyladenosine
(m(6)A) residues-a reversible base modification of unknown function in long
non-coding RNAs. We show that m(6)A formation in XIST, as well as in cellular
mRNAs, is mediated by RNA-binding motif protein 15 (RBM15) and its paralogue
RBM15B, which bind the m(6)A-methylation complex and recruit it to specific sites
in RNA. This results in the methylation of adenosine nucleotides in adjacent
m(6)A consensus motifs. Furthermore, we show that knockdown of RBM15 and RBM15B, 
or knockdown of methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3), an m(6)A methyltransferase,
impairs XIST-mediated gene silencing. A systematic comparison of m(6)A-binding
proteins shows that YTH domain containing 1 (YTHDC1) preferentially recognizes
m(6)A residues on XIST and is required for XIST function. Additionally,
artificial tethering of YTHDC1 to XIST rescues XIST-mediated silencing upon loss 
of m(6)A. These data reveal a pathway of m(6)A formation and recognition required
for XIST-mediated transcriptional repression.

Xist is an X-linked gene responsible for cis induction of X chromosome
inactivation. Studies have indicated that Xist is abnormally activated in the
active X chromosome in cloned mouse embryos due to loss of the maternal
Xist-repressing imprint following enucleation during somatic cell nuclear
transfer (SCNT). Inhibition of Xist expression by injecting small interfering RNA
(siRNA) has been shown to enhance the in vivo developmental efficiency of cloned 
male mouse embryos by more than 10-fold. The purpose of this study was to
investigate whether a similar procedure can be applied to improve the cloning
efficiency in pigs. We first found that Xist mRNA levels at the morula stage were
aberrantly higher in pig SCNT embryos than in in vivo fertilization-derived pig
embryos. Injection of a preselected effective anti-Xist siRNA into 1-cell-stage
male pig SCNT embryos resulted in significant inhibition of Xist expression
through the 16-cell stage. This siRNA-mediated inhibition of Xist significantly
increased the total cell number per cloned blastocyst and significantly improved 
the birth rate of cloned healthy piglets. The present study contributes useful
information on the action of Xist in the development of pig SCNT embryos and
proposes a new method for enhancing the efficiency of pig cloning.

Unfrozen archived newborn blood spots (NBS) have been shown to retain sufficient 
messenger RNA (mRNA) for gene expression profiling. However, the effect of
storage time at ambient temperature for NBS samples in relation to the quality of
gene expression data is relatively unknown. Here, we evaluated mRNA expression
from quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and microarray data obtained from NBS
samples stored at ambient temperature to determine the effect of storage time on 
the quality of gene expression. These data were generated in a previous
case-control study examining NBS in 53 children with cerebral palsy (CP) and 53
matched controls. NBS sample storage period ranged from 3 to 16years at ambient
temperature. We found persistently low RNA integrity numbers (RIN=2.3±0.71) and
28S/18S rRNA ratios (~0) across NBS samples for all storage periods. In both
qRT-PCR and microarray data, the expression of three common housekeeping
genes-beta cytoskeletal actin (ACTB), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH), and peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA)-decreased with increased storage
time. Median values of each microarray probe intensity at log2 scale also
decreased over time. After eight years of storage, probe intensity values were
largely reduced to background intensity levels. Of 21,500 genes tested, 89%
significantly decreased in signal intensity, with 13,551, 10,730, and 9925 genes 
detected within 5years, > 5 to <10years, and >10years of storage, respectively.
We also examined the expression of two gender-specific genes (X
inactivation-specific transcript, XIST and lysine-specific demethylase 5D, KDM5D)
and seven gene sets representing the inflammatory, hypoxic, coagulative, and
thyroidal pathways hypothesized to be related to CP risk to determine the effect 
of storage time on the detection of these biologically relevant genes. We found
the gender-specific genes and CP-related gene sets detectable in all storage
periods, but exhibited differential expression (between male vs. female or CP vs.
control) only within the first six years of storage. We concluded that gene
expression data quality deteriorates in unfrozen archived NBS over time and that 
differential gene expression profiling and analysis is recommended for those NBS 
samples collected and stored within six years at ambient temperature.

OBJECTIVE: To reveal the involvement of molecules in the pathogenesis of B-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) by bioinformatics analyses.
METHODS: The microarray data of B-ALL were downloaded from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database and Qlucore Omics Explorer software was used to screen
differentially expressed miRNA. Based on the differentially expressed miRNAs, we 
predicted the target genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) and transcription
factors (TFs). Then we constructed the miRNAs-centered comprehensive regulatory
network. In addition, we performed functional enrichment analysis to analyze the 
functions of target genes.
RESULTS: Of all the 15 differentially expressed miRNAs, 7 miRNAs were of
overexpression, 8 miRNAs underexpressed. From the miRNAs comprehensive regulatory
network, we found that hsa-miR-486-3p and hsa-miR-126 regulated a large number of
target genes, hsa-miR-126 including target genes MYC. The hsa-miR-29a,
hsa-miR-130a and hsa-miR-181c regu- lated a lot of lncRNAs containing
X-inactive-specific transcript (XIST). The hsa-miR-181a-2, hsa-miR- 181b-2 and
hsa-miR-663 were regulated by a host of TFs including caudal- related homeobox
transcription fact2 (CDX2). Additionally, the target genes of has-miR-126 were
enriched in Wnt pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of hsa-miR-29a , hsa-miR-126 and has-miR-181 family
were significantly different in B-ALL. Target gene of MYC, TFs of CDX2 and lncRNA
of XIST may play important roles in the development of B-ALL, serving as a
potential therapeutic target.

In female mammals, X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a key process in the
control of gene dosage compensation between X-linked genes and autosomes. Xist
and Tsix, two overlapping antisense transcribed noncoding genes, are central
elements of the X inactivation center (Xic) regulating XCI. Xist up-regulation
results in coating of the entire X chromosome by Xist RNA in cis, whereas Tsix
transcription acts as a negative regulator of Xist Here, we generated Xist and
Tsix reporter mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell lines, to study the genetic and
dynamic regulation of these genes upon differentiation. Our results revealed
mutually antagonistic roles for Tsix on Xist and vice versa, and indicate the
presence of semi-stable transcriptional states of the Xic predicting the outcome 
of XCI. These transcriptional states are instructed by the X to autosome ratio,
directed by regulators of XCI, and can be modulated by tissue culture conditions.

BACKGROUND: Chromosome counting is a process in which cells determine somehow
their intrinsic chromosome number(s). The best-studied cellular mechanism that
involves chromosome counting is 'chromosome-kissing' and X-chromosome
inactivation (XCI) mechanism. It is necessary for the well-known dosage
compensation between the genders in mammals to balance the number of active
X-chromosomes (Xa) with regard to diploid set of autosomes. At the onset of XCI, 
two X-chromosomes are coming in close proximity and pair physically by a specific
segment denominated X-pairing region (Xpr) that involves the SLC16A2 gene.
RESULTS: An Ensembl BLAST search for human and mouse SLC16A2/Slc16a2 homologues
revealed, that highly similar sequences can be found at almost each chromosome in
the corresponding genomes. Additionally, a BLAST search for SLC16A2/TSIX/XIST
(genes responsible for XCI) reveled that "SLC16A2/TSIX/XIST like sequences" cover
equally all chromosomes, too. With respect to this we provide following
hypotheses.
HYPOTHESES: If a single genomic region containing the SLC16A2 gene on
X-chromosome is responsible for maintaining "balanced" active copy numbers, it is
possible that similar sequences or gene/s have the same function on other
chromosomes (autosomes). SLC16A2 like sequences on autosomes could encompass
evolutionary older, but functionally active key regions for chromosome counting
in early embryogenesis. Also SLC16A2 like sequence on autosomes could be involved
in inappropriate chromosomes pairing and, thereby be involved in aneuploidy
formation during embryogenesis and cancer development. Also, "SLC16A2/TSIX/XIST
gene like sequence combinations" covering the whole genome, could be important
for the determination of X:autosome ratio in cells and chromosome counting.
CONCLUSIONS: SLC16A2 and/or SLC16A2/TSIX/XIST like sequence dispersed across
autosomes and X-chromosome(s) could serve as bases for a counting mechanism to
determine X:autosome ratio and could potentially be a mechanism by which a cell
also counts its autosomes. It could also be that such specific genomic regions
have the same function for each specific autosome. As errors during the obviously
existing process of chromosome counting are one if not the major origin of
germline/somatic aneuploidy the here presented hypotheses should further
elaborated and experimentally tested.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) X inactivate-specific transcript (XIST) has been
verified as an oncogenic gene in several human malignant tumors, and its
dysregulation was closed associated with tumor initiation, development and
progression. Nevertheless, whether the aberrant expression of XIST in human
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is corrected with malignancy, metastasis or
prognosis has not been elaborated. Here, we discovered that XIST was up-regulated
in NPC tissues and higher expression of XIST contributed to a markedly poorer
survival time. In addition, multivariate analysis demonstrated XIST was an
independent risk factor for prognosis. XIST over-expression enhanced, while XIST 
silencing hampered the cell growth in NPC. Additionally, mechanistic analysis
revealed that XIST up-regulated the expression of miR-34a-5p targeted gene E2F3
through acting as a competitive 'sponge' of miR-34a-5p. Taking all into account, 
we concluded that XIST functioned as an oncogene in NPC through up-regulating
E2F3 in part through 'spongeing' miR-34a-5p.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression,
interacting with the major pathways of cell growth, proliferation,
differentiation and survival. Alterations in the function of lncRNAs promote
tumor formation, progression and metastasis. The purpose of the present study was
to identify novel tumor suppressor lncRNAs, and elucidate their physiological
function and mechanism in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The results of the present 
study revealed that the expression of the lncRNA, TRIM52‑AS1, was downregulated
in RCC, which was demonstrated using reverse transcription‑quantitative
polymerase chain reaction analysis. Furthermore, the effects of TRIM52‑AS1 on
proliferation, cell migration and apoptosis were analyzed using a wound scratch
assay, a 3‑(4,5‑dimethylthiazol‑2yl)‑2,5‑diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay and
flow cytometric analysis, respectively. The overexpression of TRIM52‑AS1 using a 
synthesized vector significantly suppressed cell migration and proliferation, and
induced apoptosis of the RCC cells in vitro, and interference of its expression
led to the opposite effects. The present study was the first, to the best of our 
knowledge, to demonstrate that TRIM52‑AS1 functions as a tumor suppressor in RCC.
Further investigation is required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
underlying the effects of TRIM52-AS1 in the development of RCC.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recently shown to play an important role
in gene regulation and normal cellular functions, and disease processes. However,
despite the overwhelming number of lncRNAs identified to date, little is known
about their role in cancer for vast majority of them. The present study aims to
determine whether lncRNAs can serve as prognostic markers in human breast cancer.
We interrogated the breast invasive carcinoma dataset of the Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) at the cBioPortal consisting of ~ 1,000 cases. Among 2,730 lncRNAs
analyzed, 577 lncRNAs had alterations ranging from 1% to 32% frequency, which
include mutations, alterations of copy number and RNA expression. We found that
deregulation of 11 lncRNAs, primarily due to copy number alteration, is
associated with poor overall survival. At RNA expression level, upregulation of 4
lncRNAs (LINC00657, LINC00346, LINC00654 and HCG11) was associated with poor
overall survival. A third signature consists of 9 lncRNAs (LINC00705, LINC00310, 
LINC00704, LINC00574, FAM74A3, UMODL1-AS1, ARRDC1-AS1, HAR1A, and LINC00323) and 
their upregulation can predict recurrence. Finally, we selected LINC00657 to
determine their role in breast cancer, and found that LINC00657 knockout
significantly suppresses tumor cell growth and proliferation, suggesting that it 
plays an oncogenic role. Together, these results highlight the clinical
significance of lncRNAs, and thus, these lncRNAs may serve as prognostic markers 
for breast cancer.

Deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 (DMBT1) is deleted during cancer progression 
and as a potential tumor-suppressor gene in various types of cancer. However, its
role in Gallbladder cancer remains poorly understood. DMBT1 has low-expression
and deletion of copy number were detected in normal tissues and GBC cancer
tissues by qRT-PCR. Knockdown of DMBT1 increased migration and invasion and

Breastmilk has many documented beneficial effects on the developing human infant,
but the components of breastmilk that influence these developmental pathways have
not been fully elucidated. Increasing evidence suggests that non-coding RNAs
encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent an important mechanism of 
communication between the mother and child. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are of
particular interest given their key role in gene expression and development.
However, it is not known whether breastmilk EVs contain lncRNAs. We used qRT-PCR 
to determine whether EVs isolated from human breastmilk contain lncRNAs
previously reported to be important for developmental processes. We detected 55
of the 87 screened lncRNAs in EVs from the 30 analyzed breastmilk samples, and
CRNDE, DANCR GAS5, SRA1 and ZFAS1 were detected in >90% of the samples. GAS5,
SNHG8 and ZFAS1 levels were highly correlated (Spearman's rho>0.9; P<0.0001),
which may indicate that the loading of these lncRNAs into breastmilk EVs is
regulated by the same pathways. The detected lncRNAs are important epigenetic
regulators involved in processes such as immune cell regulation and metabolism.
They may target a repertoire of recipient cells in offspring and could be
essential for child development and health. Further experimental and
epidemiological studies are warranted to determine the impact of breastmilk
EV-encapsulated lnRNAs in mother to child signaling.

Colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) is the most upregulated
long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in glioma. Herein, the function and potential
molecular mechanisms of CRNDE and miR-384 were illustrated in glioma cells. CRNDE
overexpression facilitated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while
inhibited glioma cells apoptosis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) demonstrated that miR-384 was downregulated in human glioma
tissues and glioma cell lines. Moreover, restoration of miR-384 exerted
tumor-suppressive functions. In addition, the expression of miR-384 was
negatively correlated with CRNDE expression. A binding region between CRNDE and
miR-384 was confirmed using luciferase assays. Moreover, CRNDE promoted cell
malignant behavior by decreasing miR-384 expression. At the molecular level,
treatment by CRNDE knockdown or miR-384 overexpression resulted in a decrease of 
piwi-like RNA-mediated gene silencing 4 (PIWIL4) protein. Besides, PIWIL4 was
identified as a target of miR-384 and plays an oncogenic role in glioma.
Similarly, downstream proteins of PIWIL4 such as STAT3, cyclin D1, VEGFA, SLUG,
MMP-9, caspase 3, Bcl-2, and bcl-xL were modulated when treated with miR-384 and 
PIWIL4. Remarkably, CRNDE knockdown combined with miR-384 overexpression led to
tumor regression in vivo. Overall, these results depicted a novel pathway
mediated by CRNDE in glioma, which may be a potential application for glioma
therapy.

Functional characterization of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their
pathological relevance is still a challenging task. Abnormal expression of a few 
long non-coding RNAs have been found associated with hepatocellular carcinoma,
with potential implications to both improve our understanding of molecular
mechanism of liver carcinogenesis and to discover biomarkers for early diagnosis 
or therapy. However, the understanding of the global role of lncRNAs during HCC
development is still in its infancy. In this study, we produced RNA-Seq data from
23 liver tissues (controls, cirrhotic and HCCs) and applied statistical and gene 
network analysis approaches to identify and characterize expressed lncRNAs. We
detected 5,525 lncRNAs across different tissue types and identified 57
differentially expressed lncRNAs in HCC compared with adjacent non-tumour tissues
using stringent criteria (FDR<0.05, Fold Change>2). Using weighted gene
co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we found that differentially expressed
lncRNAs are co-expressed with genes involved in cell cycle regulation, TGF-β
signalling and liver metabolism. Furthermore, we found that more than 20% of
differentially expressed lncRNAs are associated to actively transcribed enhancers
and that the co-expression patterns with their closest genes change dramatically 
during HCC development. Our study provides the most comprehensive compendium of
lncRNAs expressed in HCC, as well as in control or cirrhotic livers. Our results 
identified both known oncogenic lncRNAs (such as H19 and CRNDE) and novel lncRNAs
involved in cell cycle deregulation and liver metabolism deficits occurring
during HCC development.

The CRNDE gene seems to play an oncogenic role in cancers, though its exact
function remains unknown. Here, we tried to assess its usefulness as a molecular 
prognostic marker in ovarian cancer. Based on results of our microarray studies, 
CRNDE transcripts were further analyzed by Real-Time qPCR-based profiling of
their expression. The qPCR study was conducted with the use of personally
designed TaqMan assays on 135 frozen tissue sections of ovarian carcinomas from
patients treated with platinum compounds and either cyclophosphamide (PC, N = 32)
or taxanes (TP, N = 103). Elevated levels of two different CRNDE transcripts were
a negative prognostic factor; they increased the risk of death and recurrence in 
the group of patients treated with TP, but not PC (DNA-damaging agents only).
Higher associations were found for overexpression of the short CRNDE splice
variant (FJ466686): HR 6.072, 95% CI 1.814-20.32, p = 0.003 (the risk of death); 
HR 15.53, 95% CI 3.812-63.28, p < 0.001 (the risk of recurrence). Additionally,
accumulation of the TP53 protein correlated with decreased expression of both
CRNDE transcripts in tumor cells. Our results depict CRNDE as a potential marker 
of poor prognosis in women with ovarian carcinomas, and suggest that its
significance depends on the therapeutic regimen used.

The long non-coding RNA Colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) is 
a novel gene that activated early in colorectal neoplasia, but it is also
up-regulated in many other solid tumors. Herein, the function and underlying
mechanism of CRNDE in regulating glioma stem cells (GSCs) were investigated. We
found that CRNDE expression was up-regulated while miR-186 expression was
down-regulated in GSCs. Overexpression of CRNDE could promote the cellular
proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibit the apoptosis in GSCs.
Overexpression of miR-186 exerted functions of inhibiting the proliferation,
migration and invasion of GSCs and promoting apoptosis. And CRNDE decreased the
expression levels of XIAP and PAK7 by binding to miR-186 and negatively
regulating it. In addition, miR-186 binded to XIAP and PAK7 3'UTR region, and
decrease the expression of them, thus regulating the expression levels of
downstream target proteins such as caspase 3, BAD, cyclin D1 and MARK2. The in
vivo effect of CRNDE and miR-186 showed that the tumor formation rate was minimum
in tumor-bearing nude mice with the knockdown of CRNDE and the overexpression of 
miR-186. In conclusion, CRNDE played an oncogenic role of GSCs through the
negative regulation of miR-186. Both CRNDE and miR-186 could be regarded as
potential targets in the glioma therapy.

Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) represent a novel class of RNAs with no functional
protein-coding ability, yet it has become increasingly clear that interactions
between lncRNAs with other molecules are responsible for important gene
regulatory functions in various contexts. Given their relatively high expressions
in the brain, lncRNAs are now thought to play important roles in normal brain
development as well as diverse disease processes including gliomagenesis.
Intriguingly, certain lncRNAs are closely associated with the initiation,
differentiation, progression, recurrence and stem-like characteristics in glioma,
and may therefore be exploited for the purposes of sub-classification, diagnosis 
and prognosis. LncRNAs may also serve as potential therapeutic targets as well as
a novel biomarkers in the treatment of glioma. In this article, the functional
aspects of lncRNAs, particularly within the central nervous system (CNS), will be
briefly discussed, followed by highlights of the important roles of lncRNAs in
mediating critical steps during glioma development. In addition, the key lncRNA
players and their possible mechanistic pathways associated with gliomagenesis
will be addressed.

Glioma, especially high-grade glioma, is highly malignant with high rate of
recurrence and poor prognosis. The mechanisms of glioma progression and
recurrence have not been elucidated. Previous studies showed that long non-coding
RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in the development and progression of glioma. However,
the roles of lncRNAs in the recurrence of glioma remain unknown. We use high
throughput microarray to screen the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in
recurrence gliomas compared with primary gliomas. We found a total of 1,111
lncRNAs were differentially expressed in recurrent group. Among these, 639
lncRNAs were up-regulated, while 472 lncRNAs were down-regulated (fold Change
≥2.0). GO (Gene ontology) and pathway analysis revealed that the potential
functions of differentially expressed lncRNAs were closely connected with the
processes of cancer progression and pathogenesis. LncRNA classification and
subgroup analysis further identified three important clusters of differentially
expressed lncRNA-mRNA pairs which have potential gene regulatory functions. This 
study for the first time showed abundant differentially expressed lncRNAs in
recurrent gliomas. Some lncRNAs may play important roles in glioma recurrence,
such as previously reported H19, CRNDE, HOTAIRM1 or unreported AC016745.3,
XLOC_001711, RP11-128A17.1. Moreover, this study set a basis for future
researches on specific lncRNA which may contribute to the recurrence of glioma.
Further studies on these lncRNAs will help to elucidate the mechanism of glioma
recurrence at genetic level and find therapeutic targets for glioma patients.

CRNDE, recently described as the lncRNA-coding gene, is overexpressed at RNA
level in human malignancies. Its role in gametogenesis, cellular differentiation 
and pluripotency has been suggested as well. Herein, we aimed to verify our
hypothesis that the CRNDE gene may encode a protein product, CRNDEP. By using
bioinformatics methods, we identified the 84-amino acid ORF encoded by one of two
CRNDE transcripts, previously described by our research team. This ORF was cloned
into two expression vectors, subsequently utilized in localization studies in
HeLa cells. We also developed a polyclonal antibody against CRNDEP. Its
specificity was confirmed in immunohistochemical, cellular localization, Western 
blot and immunoprecipitation experiments, as well as by showing a statistically
significant decrease of endogenous CRNDEP expression in the cells with transient 
shRNA-mediated knockdown of CRNDE. Endogenous CRNDEP localizes predominantly to
the nucleus and its expression seems to be elevated in highly proliferating
tissues, like the parabasal layer of the squamous epithelium, intestinal crypts
or spermatocytes. After its artificial overexpression in HeLa cells, in a fusion 
with either the EGFP or DsRed Monomer fluorescent tag, CRNDEP seems to stimulate 
the formation of stress granules and localize to them. Although the exact role of
CRNDEP is unknown, our preliminary results suggest that it may be involved in the
regulation of the cell proliferation. Possibly, CRNDEP also participates in
oxygen metabolism, considering our in silico results, and the correlation between
its enforced overexpression and the formation of stress granules. This is the
first report showing the existence of a peptide encoded by the CRNDE gene.

The transcripts of the gene Colorectal Neoplasia Differentially Expressed (CRNDE)
are recognized as long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are expressed in specific 
regions within the human brain, and are the most upregulated lncRNA in gliomas.
However, the underlying regulation and function of CRNDE in gliomas are largely
unknown. In this study, the upregulation of CRNDE was confirmed in both primary
specimens from glioma patients and in vitro with cell lines. Overexpression of
specific CRNDE transcript promotes cell growth and migration in vitro while
knockdown of CRNDE expression manifests a repressive function during these
cellular processes. The growth promoting effect of CRNDE was also demonstrated in
a xenograft mouse model. Mechanistic studies further revealed that histone
acetylation in the promoter region might account for the upregulation of CRNDE,
and the level of CRNDE expression could be modulated by mammalian Target of
Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in glioma. Thus, our results shed a light on utilizing
CRNDE as a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of glioma.

Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs has recently been reported in
tumorigenesis and plays a pivotal role in regulating malignant behavior of
cancers. In this study, we confirmed that the long noncoding RNAs human
histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex P5 (HCP5) was up-regulated in 
glioma tissues as well as in U87 and U251 cells. Knockdown of HCP5 inhibited the 
malignant biological behavior of glioma cells by reducing proliferation,
migration and invasion, and inducing apoptosis. HCP5 regulated the malignant
behavior of glioma cells by binding to microRNA-139, which functions as a tumor
suppressor. Moreover, knockdown of HCP5 down-regulated Runt-related transcription
factor 1, a direct and functional downstream target of microRNA-139 that is
involved in microRNA-139-mediated tumor-suppressive effects in glioma cells.
Runt-related transcription factor 1 increased promoter activities and upregulated
expression of the oncogenic gene astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1). Runt-related 
transcription factor 1 also increased the promoter activities and expression of
HCP5, which showed a positive feedback loop in regulating the malignant behavior 
of glioma cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the
HCP5-microRNA-139- Runt-related transcription factor 1 feedback loop plays a
pivotal role in regulating the malignant behavior of glioma cells, which may
provide a potential therapeutic strategy for treating glioma.Molecular Therapy

Pathogens infecting mammalian cells have developed various strategies to suppress
and evade their hosts' defensive mechanisms. In this line, the intracellular
bacteria that are able to survive and propagate within their host cells must have
developed strategies to avert their host's killing attitude. Studying the
interface of host-pathogen confrontation can provide valuable information for
defining therapeutic approaches. Brucellosis, caused by the Brucella strains, is 
a zoonotic bacterial disease that affects thousands of humans and animals around 
the world inflicting discomfort and huge economic losses. Similar to many other
intracellular dwelling bacteria, infections caused by Brucella are difficult to
treat, and hence any attempt at identifying new and common therapeutic targets
would prove beneficial for the purpose of curing infections caused by the
intracellular bacteria. In THP-1 macrophage infected with Brucella melitensis we 
studied the expression levels of four host's genes, i.e. EMP2, ST8SIA4, HCP5 and 
FRMD5 known to be involved in pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our
data showed that at this molecular level, except for FRMD5 that was
downregulated, the other three genes were upregulated by B. melitensis. Brucella 
melitensis and M. tuberculosis go through similar intracellular processes and
interestingly two of the investigated genes, i.e. EMP2 and ST4SIA8 were
upregulated in THP-1 cell infected with B. melitensis similar to that reported
for THP-1 cells infected with M. tuberculosis. At the host-pathogen interaction
interface, this study depicts overlapping changes for different bacteria with
common survival strategies; a fact that implies designing therapeutic approaches 
based on common targets may be possible.

BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a neoplasm of the epithelial lining
of the nasopharynx. Despite various reports linking genomic variants to NPC
predisposition, very few reports were done on copy number variations (CNV). CNV
is an inherent structural variation that has been found to be involved in cancer 
predisposition.
METHODS: A discovery cohort of Malaysian Chinese descent (NPC patients, n = 140; 
Healthy controls, n = 256) were genotyped using Illumina® HumanOmniExpress
BeadChip. PennCNV and cnvPartition calling algorithms were applied for CNV
calling. Taqman CNV assays and digital PCR were used to validate CNV calls and
replicate candidate copy number variant region (CNVR) associations in a follow-up
Malaysian Chinese (NPC cases, n = 465; and Healthy controls, n = 677) and Malay
cohort (NPC cases, n = 114; Healthy controls, n = 124).
RESULTS: Six putative CNVRs overlapping GRM5, MICA/HCP5/HCG26, LILRB3/LILRA6,
DPY19L2, RNase3/RNase2 and GOLPH3 genes were jointly identified by PennCNV and
cnvPartition. CNVs overlapping GRM5 and MICA/HCP5/HCG26 were subjected to further
validation by Taqman CNV assays and digital PCR. Combined analysis in Malaysian
Chinese cohort revealed a strong association at CNVR on chromosome 11q14.3
(Pcombined = 1.54x10-5; odds ratio (OR) = 7.27; 95% CI = 2.96-17.88) overlapping 
GRM5 and a suggestive association at CNVR on chromosome 6p21.3 (Pcombined =
1.29x10-3; OR = 4.21; 95% CI = 1.75-10.11) overlapping MICA/HCP5/HCG26 genes.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the association of CNVs towards NPC
susceptibility, implicating a possible role of CNVs in NPC development.

BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with
complex pathogenesis in which genes and environmental factors are involved. We
aimed at analyzing previously identified loci associated with SLE or with other
autoimmune and/or inflammatory disorders (STAT4, IL10, IL23R, IRAK1, PSORS1C1,
HCP5, MIR146a, PTPN2, ERAP1, ATG16L1, IRGM) in a sample of Italian SLE patients
in order to verify or confirm their possible involvement and relative
contribution in the disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred thirty-nine consecutive SLE patients and 278
matched healthy controls were enrolled. Study protocol included complete physical
examination, and clinical and laboratory data collection. Nineteen polymorphisms 
were genotyped by allelic discrimination assays. A case-control association study
and a genotype-phenotype correlation were performed.
RESULTS: STAT4 was the most associated gene [P = 3 × 10(-7), OR = 2.13 (95% CI:
1.59-2.85)]. IL10 confirmed its association with SLE [rs3024505: P = 0.02, OR =
1.52 (95% CI: 1.07-2.16)]. We describe a novel significant association between
HCP5 locus and SLE susceptibility [rs3099844: P = 0.01, OR = 2.06 (95% CI:
1.18-3.6)]. The genotype/phenotype correlation analysis showed several
associations including a higher risk to develop pericarditis with STAT4, and an
association between HCP5 rs3099844 and anti-Ro/SSA antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: STAT4 and IL10 confirm their association with SLE. We found that
some SNPs in PSORS1C1, ATG16L1, IL23R, PTPN2 and MIR146a genes can determine
particular disease phenotypes. HCP5 rs3099844 is associated with SLE and with
anti-Ro/SSA. This polymorphism has been previously found associated with cardiac 
manifestations of SLE, a condition related with anti-Ro/SSA antibodies. Thus, our
results may provide new insights into SLE pathogenesis.

Herpes zoster, commonly referred to as shingles, is caused by the varicella
zoster virus (VZV). VZV initially manifests as chicken pox, most commonly in
childhood, can remain asymptomatically latent in nerve tissues for many years and
often re-emerges as shingles. Although reactivation may be related to immune
suppression, aging and female sex, most inter-individual variability in
re-emergence risk has not been explained to date. We performed a genome-wide
association analyses in 22,981 participants (2280 shingles cases) from the
electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network. Using Cox survival and logistic 
regression, we identified a genomic region in the combined and European ancestry 
groups that has an age of onset effect reaching genome-wide significance (P>1.0 ×
10(-8)). This region tags the non-coding gene HCP5 (HLA Complex P5) in the major 
histocompatibility complex. This gene is an endogenous retrovirus and likely
influences viral activity through regulatory functions. Variants in this genetic 
region are known to be associated with delay in development of AIDS in people
infected by HIV. Our study provides further suggestion that this region may have 
a critical role in viral suppression and could potentially harbor a clinically
actionable variant for the shingles vaccine.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease occurred under the interaction
of genetic and environmental factors. The genes HLA complex P5 (HCP5),
spermatogenesis associated 2 (SPATA2), tumour necrosis factor alpha-induced
protein 3 (TNFAIP3), TNFAIP3-interacting protein 1 (TNIP1) and the component of
oligomeric Golgi complex 6 (COG6) were reported to be associated with psoriasis
in western populations by genome-wide association studies. The aim of this study 
was to investigate whether the HCP5, TNIP1, TNFAIP3, SPATA2 and COG6 genes were
genetic risk factors for psoriasis in Chinese population. One single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) from each gene was evaluated using Chinese patients with
psoriasis (n = 201) and controls (n = 300). The results demonstrated that SNPs
rs2395029, rs17728338 and rs610604 from the HCP5, TNIP1 and TNFAIP3 genes,
respectively, were associated with psoriasis in the studied population at both
genotype level and allelic level (P < 0.05). Thus, the data suggested that HCP5, 
TNIP1 and TNFAIP3 may play a role in common pathogenic of psoriasis in Chinese
and confer risk factors for psoriasis in various ethnic populations. These
results provide potential makers for diagnosing, treating and preventing the
psoriasis.

Past genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving individuals with AIDS have 
mainly identified associations in the HLA region. Using the latest software, we
imputed 7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)/indels of the 1000
Genomes Project from the GWAS-determined genotypes of individuals in the Genomics
of Resistance to Immunodeficiency Virus AIDS nonprogression cohort and compared
them with those of control cohorts. The strongest signals were in MICA, the gene 
encoding major histocompatibility class I polypeptide-related sequence A (P =
3.31 × 10(-12)), with a particular exonic deletion (P = 1.59 × 10(-8)) in full
linkage disequilibrium with the reference HCP5 rs2395029 SNP. Haplotype analysis 
also revealed an additive effect between HLA-C, HLA-B, and MICA variants. These
data suggest a role for MICA in progression and elite control of human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.

Human males absent on the first (hMOF), a human ortholog of the Drosophila MOF
protein, is responsible for histone H4 lysine 16 (H4K16) acetylation in human
cells. The depletion of hMOF leads to a global reduction in histone H4K16
acetylation in human cells, genomic instability, cell cycle defects, reduced
transcription of certain genes, defective DNA damage repair and early embryonic
lethality. Studies have shown that abnormal hMOF gene expression is involved in a
number of primary cancers. The present study examined the involvement of hMOF
expression and histone H4K16 acetylation in clinically diagnosed primary ovarian 
cancer tissues. Clinically diagnosed frozen primary ovarian cancer tissues were
used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative PCR (qPCR), western
blotting and immunohistochemical staining approaches. A PCR analysis of mRNA
expression in 47 samples revealed a downregulation of hMOF mRNA in 81% of
patients, whereas only 13% of patients demonstrated upregulation. qPCR was used
to validate the frequent downregulation of hMOF expression in the primary ovarian
cancer tissues. As expected, the analysis of hMOF expression in 57 samples
revealed that hMOF mRNA expression was significantly downregulated (>2-fold
decrease) in 65% of patients, while a <2-fold reduction of hMOF was observed in
10.5% of patients. Furthermore, the expression of hMOF-regulated human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA) complex 5, (HCP5), was also found to be downregulated in >87% of
patients with a decrease in hMOF. hMOF and its regulated gene, HCP5, are
frequently downregulated in human ovarian cancer, suggesting that hMOF may be
involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recently, genetic variations in MICA (lead single nucleotide
polymorphism [SNP] rs2596542) were identified by a genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) to be associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) in Japanese patients. In the present study, we sought to
determine whether this SNP is predictive of HCC development in the Caucasian
population as well.
METHODS: An extended region around rs2596542 was genotyped in 1924 HCV-infected
patients from the Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study (SCCS). Pair-wise correlation
between key SNPs was calculated both in the Japanese and European populations
(HapMap3: CEU and JPT).
RESULTS: To our surprise, the minor allele A of rs2596542 in proximity of MICA
appeared to have a protective impact on HCC development in Caucasians, which
represents an inverse association as compared to the one observed in the Japanese
population. Detailed fine-mapping analyses revealed a new SNP in HCP5 (rs2244546)
upstream of MICA as strong predictor of HCV-related HCC in the SCCS (univariable 
p=0.027; multivariable p=0.0002, odds ratio=3.96, 95% confidence
interval=1.90-8.27). This newly identified SNP had a similarly directed effect on
HCC in both Caucasian and Japanese populations, suggesting that rs2244546 may
better tag a putative true variant than the originally identified SNPs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirms the MICA/HCP5 region as susceptibility locus for
HCV-related HCC and identifies rs2244546 in HCP5 as a novel tagging SNP. In
addition, our data exemplify the need for conducting meta-analyses of cohorts of 
different ethnicities in order to fine map GWAS signals.

OBJECTIVES: About 2-5% of HIV-1-infected subjects, defined as long-term
non-progressors (LTNPs), remain immunologically stable for a long time without
treatment. The factors governing this condition are known only in part, and
include genetic factors. Thus, we studied 20 polymorphisms of 15 genes encoding
proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines, chemokines and their receptors,
genes involved in apoptosis, and the gene HCP5.
METHODS: We analyzed 47 Caucasian LTNPs infected for >9 years, compared with 131 
HIV-1-infected Caucasian patients defined as 'usual progressors'. The genotypes
were determined by methods based upon PCR, and the statistical analysis was
performed by univariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: The well-known CCR5Δ32 del32 allele, the cell death-related TNF-α-238 A 
and PDCD1-7209 T alleles, and HCP5 rs2395029 G, a non-coding protein associated
with the HLA-B*5701, were found positively associated with the LTNP condition. No
association was observed for other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SDF-1-801,
IL-10-592, MCP-1-2518, CX3CR1 V249I, CCR2V64I, RANTES-403, IL-2-330, IL-1β-511,
IL-4-590, FASL IVS3nt-169, FAS-670, FAS-1377, FASL IVS2nt-124, PDCD1-7146,
MMP-7-181, and MMP7-153).
CONCLUSIONS: The novel genetic associations between allelic variants of genes
TNF-α-238 and PDCD1-7209 with the LTNP condition underline the importance of host
genetic factors in the progression of HIV-1 infection and in immunological
preservation.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression by acting with microRNAs
(miRNAs). However, the roles of cancer specific lncRNA and its related
competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) network in hepatocellular cell carcinoma
(HCC) are not fully understood. The lncRNA profiles in 372 HCC patients,
including 372 tumor and 48 adjacent non-tumor liver tissues, from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) and NCBI GEO omnibus (GSE65485) were analyzed. Cancer
specific lncRNAs (or HCC related lncRNAs) were identified and correlated with
clinical features. Based on bioinformatics generated from miRcode, starBase, and 
miRTarBase, we constructed an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network (ceRNA network) in HCC.
We found 177 cancer specific lncRNAs in HCC (fold change ≥ 1.5, P < 0.01), 41 of 
them were also discriminatively expressed with gender, race, tumor grade, AJCC
tumor stage, and AJCC TNM staging system. Six lncRNAs (CECR7, LINC00346,
MAPKAPK5-AS1, LOC338651, FLJ90757, and LOC283663) were found to be significantly 
associated with overall survival (OS, log-rank P < 0.05). Collectively, our
results showed the lncRNA expression patterns and a complex ceRNA network in HCC,
and identified a complex cancer specific ceRNA network, which includes 14 lncRNAs
and 17 miRNAs in HCC.

BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein coding transcripts
regulating a variety of physiological and pathological functions. However, their 
implication in heart failure is still largely unknown. The aim of this study is
to identify and characterize lncRNAs deregulated in patients affected by ischemic
heart failure.
METHODS: LncRNAs were profiled and validated in left ventricle biopsies of 18
patients affected by non end-stage dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy and 17 matched
controls. Further validations were performed in left ventricle samples derived
from explanted hearts of end-stage heart failure patients and in a mouse model of
cardiac hypertrophy, obtained by transverse aortic constriction. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells of heart failure patients were also analyzed. LncRNA
distribution in the heart was assessed by in situ hybridization. Function of the 
deregulated lncRNA was explored analyzing the expression of the neighbor mRNAs
and by gene ontology analysis of the correlating coding transcripts.
RESULTS: Fourteen lncRNAs were significantly modulated in non end-stage heart
failure patients, identifying a heart failure lncRNA signature. Nine of these
lncRNAs (CDKN2B-AS1/ANRIL, EGOT, H19, HOTAIR, LOC285194/TUSC7, RMRP, RNY5,
SOX2-OT and SRA1) were also confirmed in end-stage failing hearts. Intriguingly, 
among the conserved lncRNAs, h19, rmrp and hotair were also induced in a mouse
model of heart hypertrophy. CDKN2B-AS1/ANRIL, HOTAIR and LOC285194/TUSC7 showed
similar modulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and heart tissue,
suggesting a potential role as disease biomarkers. Interestingly, RMRP displayed 
a ubiquitous nuclear distribution, while H19 RNA was more abundant in blood
vessels and was both cytoplasmic and nuclear. Gene ontology analysis of the mRNAs
displaying a significant correlation in expression with heart failure lncRNAs
identified numerous pathways and functions involved in heart failure progression.
CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly suggest lncRNA implication in the molecular
mechanisms underpinning HF.

BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is a heterogeneous mood disorder associated with
several important clinical comorbidities, such as eating disorders. This clinical
heterogeneity complicates the identification of genetic variants contributing to 
bipolar susceptibility. Here we investigate comorbidity of eating disorders as a 
subphenotype of bipolar disorder to identify genetic variation that is common and
unique to both disorders.
METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association analysis contrasting 184 bipolar 
subjects with eating disorder comorbidity against both 1370 controls and 2006
subjects with bipolar disorder only from the Bipolar Genome Study (BiGS).
RESULTS: The most significant genome-wide finding was observed bipolar with
comorbid eating disorder vs. controls within SOX2-OT (p=8.9×10(-8) for rs4854912)
with a secondary peak in the adjacent FXR1 gene (p=1.2×10(-6) for rs1805576) on
chromosome 3q26.33. This region was also the most prominent finding in the
case-only analysis (p=3.5×10(-7) and 4.3×10(-6), respectively). Several regions
of interest containing genes involved in neurodevelopment and neuroprotection
processes were also identified.
LIMITATIONS: While our primary finding did not quite reach genome-wide
significance, likely due to the relatively limited sample size, these results can
be viewed as a replication of a recent study of eating disorders in a large
cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings replicate the prior association of SOX2-OT with
eating disorders and broadly support the involvement of
neurodevelopmental/neuroprotective mechanisms in the pathophysiology of both
disorders. They further suggest that different clinical manifestations of bipolar
disorder may reflect differential genetic contributions and argue for the utility
of clinical subphenotypes in identifying additional molecular pathways leading to
illness.

Analysis of 600 kb of sequence encompassing the beta-prime adaptin (BAM22) gene
on human chromosome 22 revealed intrachromosomal duplications within 22q12-13
resulting in three active RFPL genes, two RFPL pseudogenes, and two pseudogenes
of BAM22. The genomic sequence of BAM22vartheta1 shows a remarkable similarity to
that of BAM22. The cDNA sequence comparison of RFPL1, RFPL2, and RFPL3 showed
95%-96% identity between the genes, which were most similar to the Ret Finger
Protein gene from human chromosome 6. The sense RFPL transcripts encode proteins 
with the tripartite structure, composed of RING finger, coiled-coil, and B30-2
domains, which are characteristic of the RING-B30 family. Each of these domains
are thought to mediate protein-protein interactions by promoting homo- or
heterodimerization. The MID1 gene on Xp22 is also a member of the RING-B30 family
and is mutated in Opitz syndrome (OS). The autosomal dominant form of OS shows
linkage to 22q11-q12. We detected a polymorphic protein-truncating allele of
RFPL1 in 8% of the population, which was not associated with the OS phenotype. We
identified 6-kb and 1.2-kb noncoding antisense mRNAs of RFPL1S and RFPL3S
antisense genes, respectively. The RFPL1S and RFPL3S genes cover substantial
portions of their sense counterparts, which suggests that the function of RFPL1S 
and RFPL3S is a post-transcriptional regulation of the sense RFPL genes. We
illustrate the role of intrachromosomal duplications in the generation of RFPL
genes, which were created by a series of duplications and share an ancestor with 
the RING-B30 domain containing genes from the major histocompatibility complex
region on human chromosome 6.

PURPOSE: Gastric cancer ranks as the most common cancer in the world. However,
the progresses of its diagnosis and treatment are still not satisfactory. The
purpose of this study is to summarize the roles of lncRNAs associated with
gastric cancer.
METHODS: We searched lncRNAs associated with gastric cancer in PubMed.
RESULTS: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), transcripts larger than 200 nucleotides, 
regulate gene expression at various levels. They are playing important roles in
the occurrence and development of gastric cancer. They are involved in signaling 
pathways, crosstalk with microRNAs, and affecting metastasis by regulating
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. By acting as oncogenes or tumor
suppressors, lncRNAs contribute to gastric cancer occurrence and development.
Several lncRNAs including HOTAIR, HULC, LINC00152, MALAT2, H19, GHET1, and GACAT3
have been demonstrated having oncogene activities, while other lncRNAs including 
LEIGC, GAS5, and FER1L4 have been thought as tumor suppressors.
CONCLUSIONS: Several lncRNAs from tissue, blood, and gastric juice have shown
potential values in gastric cancer diagnosis or prognosis evaluation.

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that lncRNAs play important roles in
regulating gene expression and are involved in various pathological processes. In
the present study, we screened the lncRNAs profile in clear cell renal cell
carcinoma (ccRCC) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and got
linc00152, a differentially expressed lncRNA that haven't been reported in ccRCC.
To further explore its role in ccRCC, the level of Linc00152 was detected in 77
paired ccRCC tissues and renal cancer cell lines by qRT-PCR, and its association 
with overall survival was assessed by statistical analysis. Linc00152 expression 
was significantly up-regulated in cancerous tissues and cell lines compared with 
normal counterparts, and high Linc00152 expression was closely associated with
advanced TNM stage. Moreover, Linc00152 was found to be able to serve as an
independent predictor of overall survival. Further experiments demonstrated that 
overexpression of Linc00152 can significantly promote cell proliferation and
invasion, inhibit cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and dramatically decrease
apoptosis in both 786O and Caki-2 cell lines, whereas the opposite results were
observed with attenuated Linc00152 expression. Our data suggest that Linc00152 is
a novel molecule involved in ccRCC progression as well as a potential prognostic 
biomarker and therapeutic target.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important regulatory roles in several human
cancers. Integrated analysis revealed that expression of long intergenic
non-coding RNA 152 (LINC00152) was significantly upregulated in gastric cancer
(GC). Further analysis in a cohort of 97 GC patients revealed that LINC00152
expression was positively correlated with tumor invasion depth, lymph node
metastasis, higher TNM stage, and poor survival. Gene set enrichment analysis
revealed that cell proliferation and cell cycle progression were increased in
patients with high LINC00152 expression. In both GC cell lines and xenograft
systems, LINC00152 overexpression facilitated GC cell proliferation by
accelerating the cell cycle, whereas LINC00152 knockdown had the opposite effect.
Moreover, by binding to enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), LINC00152 promotes GC
tumor cell cycle progression by silencing the expression of p15 and p21. These
findings suggest that LINC00152 may play contribute to the progression of GC and 
may be an effective therapeutic target.

BACKGROUND: Although Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) is the dominant
gastrointestinal pathogen, the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying
H.pylori-related diseases have not been fully elucidated. Long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) have been identified in eukaryotic cells, many of which play important 
roles in regulating biological processes and pathogenesis. However, the
expression changes of lncRNAs in human infected by H.pylori have been rarely
reported. This study aimed to identify the dysregulated lncRNAs in human gastric 
epithelial cells and tissues infected with H.pylori.
METHODS: The aberrant expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in GES-1 cells
with or without H.pylori infection were explored by microarray analysis.
LncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was constructed based on Pearson correlation
analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG Pathway analyses of aberrantly expressed
mRNAs were performed to identify the related biological functions and pathologic 
pathways. The expression changes of target lncRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR to
confirm the microarray data in both cells and clinical specimens.
RESULTS: Three hundred three lncRNAs and 565 mRNAs were identified as aberrantly 
expressed transcripts (≥2 or ≤0.5-fold change, P < 0.05) in cells with H.pylori
infection compared to controls. LncRNA-mRNA co-expression network showed the core
lncRNAs/mRNAs which might play important roles in H.pylori-related pathogenesis. 
GO and KEGG analyses have indicated that the functions of aberrantly expressed
mRNAs in H.pylori infection were related closely with inflammation and
carcinogenesis. QRT-PCR data confirmed the expression pattern of 8 (n345630,
XLOC_004787, n378726, LINC00473, XLOC_005517, LINC00152, XLOC_13370, and n408024)
lncRNAs in infected cells. Additionally, four down-regulated (n345630,
XLOC_004787, n378726, and LINC00473) lncRNAs were verified in H.pylori-positive
gastric samples.
CONCLUSION: Our study provided a preliminary exploration of lncRNAs expression
profiles in H.pylori-infected cells by microarray. These dysregulated lncRNAs
might contribute to the pathological processes during H.pylori infection.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: The alterations of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are related to
multiple diseases. They can be detected in plasma as biomarkers for the diagnosis
of multiple diseases. In this study, we aimed to determine the expression of
circulating lncRNAs in human, which may be promising biomarkers for the diagnosis
of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: Eight lncRNAs were chosen as candidates on the basis of the literature
to evaluate the diagnostic value and accuracy of the plasma lncRNA profiling
system. The candidate lncRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR arranged in the training 
and validation sets. Additional double-blind testing was performed in 20 patients
clinically suspected of having HCC.
RESULTS: Circulating HULC and Linc00152 were significantly up-regulated in plasma
samples of HCC patients during training set and validation set. Areas under the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the validated two lncRNAs
signature were 0.78 and 0.85, respectively. Combination of HULC and Linc00152
possessed a moderate ability to discrimination between HCC and control with an
area under ROC value of 0.87 while the combination of AFP was 0.89 with a
positive correlation with tissues expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that both plasma levels of HULC and Linc00152
achieve a fine diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing ontogenesis and metastasis of
HCC and may act as novel biomarkers for HCC.

Gastric cancer remains a serious threat to public health with high incidence and 
mortality worldwide. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) play important roles in regulating gene expression and are involved in 
various pathological processes, including gastric cancer. To investigate the
possible role of dysregulated lncRNAs in gastric cancer development, we performed
lncRNA microarray and identified 3141 significantly differentially expressed
lncRNAs in gastric cancer tissues. Next, some of deregulated lncRNAs were
validated among about 60 paired gastric cancer specimens such as Linc00261,
DKFZP434K028, RPL34-AS1, H19, HOTAIR and Linc00152. Our results found that the
decline of DKFZP434K028 and RPL34-AS1, and the increased expression of Linc00152 
positively correlated with larger tumor size. The high expression levels of
HOTAIR were associated with lymphatic metastasis and poor differentiation. Since 
the biological roles of Linc00152 are largely unknown in gastric cancer
pathogenesis, we assessed its functions by silencing its up-regulation in gastric
cancer cells. We found that Linc00152 knockdown could inhibit cell proliferation 
and colony formation, promote cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, trigger late
apoptosis, reduce the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, and
suppress cell migration and invasion. Taken together, we delineate the gastric
cancer lncRNA signature and demonstrate the oncogenic functions of Linc00152.
These findings may have implications for developing lncRNA-based biomarkers for
diagnosis and therapeutics for gastric cancer.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies identified microRNAs (miRNAs) and messenger RNAs
with significantly different expression between normal pancreas and pancreatic
cancer (PDAC) tissues. Due to technological limitations of microarrays and
real-time PCR systems these studies focused on a fixed set of targets. Expression
of other RNA classes such as long intergenic non-coding RNAs or sno-derived RNAs 
has rarely been examined in pancreatic cancer. Here, we analysed the coding and
non-coding transcriptome of six PDAC and five control tissues using
next-generation sequencing.
RESULTS: Besides the confirmation of several deregulated mRNAs and miRNAs, miRNAs
without previous implication in PDAC were detected: miR-802, miR-2114 or miR-561.
SnoRNA-derived RNAs (e.g. sno-HBII-296B) and piR-017061, a piwi-interacting RNA, 
were found to be differentially expressed between PDAC and control tissues. In
silico target analysis of miR-802 revealed potential binding sites in the 3' UTR 
of TCF4, encoding a transcription factor that controls Wnt signalling genes.
Overexpression of miR-802 in MiaPaCa pancreatic cancer cells reduced TCF4 protein
levels. Using Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) we identified differential
expression of 43 lincRNAs, long intergenic non-coding RNAs, e.g. LINC00261 and
LINC00152 as well as several natural antisense transcripts like HNF1A-AS1 and
AFAP1-AS1. Differential expression was confirmed by qPCR on the
mRNA/miRNA/lincRNA level and by immunohistochemistry on the protein level.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we report a novel lncRNA, sncRNA and mRNA signature of PDAC.
In silico prediction of ncRNA targets allowed for assigning potential functions
to differentially regulated RNAs.

Colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most malignant cancers, is currently the
fourth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Recent studies indicated that
long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) could be robust molecular prognostic biomarkers
that can refine the conventional tumor-node-metastasis staging system to predict 
the outcomes of CRC patients. In this study, the lncRNA expression profiles were 
analyzed in five datasets (GSE24549, GSE24550, GSE35834, GSE50421, and GSE31737) 
by probe set reannotation and an lncRNA classification pipeline. Twenty-five
lncRNAs were differentially expressed between CRC tissue and tumor-adjacent
normal tissue samples. In these 25 lncRNAs, patients with higher expression of
LINC01296, LINC00152, and FIRRE showed significantly better overall survival than
those with lower expression (P < 0.05), suggesting that these lncRNAs might be
associated with prognosis. Multivariate analysis indicated that LINC01296
overexpression was an independent predictor for patients' prognosis in the test
datasets (GSE24549, GSE24550) (P = 0.001) and an independent validation series
(GSE39582) (P = 0.027). Our results suggest that LINC01296 could be a novel
prognosis biomarker for the diagnosis of CRC.

In this study, we focused on two biological products as ideal tools for
toxicological assessment: long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and human-induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). lncRNAs are an important class of pervasive
non-protein-coding transcripts involved in the molecular mechanisms associated
with responses to cellular stresses. hiPSCs possess the capabilities of
self-renewal and differentiation into multiple cell types, and they are free of
the ethical issues associated with human embryonic stem cells. Here, we
identified six novel lncRNAs (CDKN2B-AS1, MIR22HG, GABPB1-AS1, FLJ33630,
LINC00152, and LINC0541471_v2) that respond to model chemical stresses
(cycloheximide, hydrogen peroxide, cadmium, or arsenic) in hiPSCs. Our results
indicated that the lncRNAs responded to general and specific chemical stresses.
Compared with typical mRNAs such as p53-related mRNAs, the lncRNAs highly and
rapidly responded to chemical stresses. We propose that these lncRNAs have the
potential to be surrogate indicators of chemical stress responses in hiPSCs.

Some long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the regulation of gene
expression by acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). However, the roles of
lncRNA associated-ceRNAs in oncogenesis are not fully understood. Here, based on 
lncRNA microarray data of gastric cancer, bioinformatic algorithm miRcode and
microRNA (miRNA) targets database TarBase, we first constructed an
lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network. Then, we confirmed it by data of six types of other
cancer including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer,
papillary thyroid carcinoma, pituitary gonadotrope tumors, ovarian cancer, and
chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The results showed a clear cancer-associated ceRNA 
network. Eight lncRNAs (AC009499.1, GACAT1, GACAT3, H19, LINC00152, AP000288.2,
FER1L4, and RP4-620F22.3) and nine miRNAs (miR-18a-5p, miR-18b-5p, miR-19a-3p,
miR-20b-5p, miR-106a-5p, miR-106b-5p, miR-31-5p, miR-139-5p, and miR-195-5p) were
involved. For instance, through its miRNA response elements (MREs) to compete for
miR-106a-5p, lncRNA-FER1L4 regulates the expression of PTEN, RB1, RUNX1, VEGFA,
CDKN1A, E2F1, HIPK3, IL-10, and PAK7. Furthermore, cellular experimental results 
indicated that FER1L4-small interfering RNA (siRNA) simultaneously suppressed
FER1L4 and RB1 mRNA level. These results suggest that lncRNAs harbor MREs and
play important roles in post-transcriptional regulation in cancer.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship of
serum vitamin D deficiency (VDD) to histologic features of non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD), and associated demographic, clinical, laboratory, and
transcriptomic data in the well-characterized Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis
Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) cohort.
METHODS: Serum vitamin D 25(OH)D (VD) was quantified by liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 190 adults (>18 years) with
biopsy-proven NAFLD. Subjects were categorized according to their level of VD as 
either sufficient (>30 ng/ml), insufficient (≥20≤30 ng/ml), or deficient (VDD;
<20 ng/ml). Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the
association of VDD and the presence of definite NASH and individual histological 
features of NAFLD after adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, alanine
aminotransferase, and diabetes status. Hepatic transcriptomic data was compared
between VDD and non-VDD subjects.
RESULTS: VDD was present in 55% of subjects and was independently associated with
definitive NASH (odds ratio (OR) 3.15, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.62-6.15,
P=0.001), increased lobular inflammation (OR=1.98, 95% CI, 1.08-3.61, P=0.026),
more ballooning (OR=2.38, 95% CI, 1.32-4.30, P=0.004), and the presence of
fibrosis (OR=2.32, 95% CI, 1.13-4.77, P=0.022). There was a significant inverse
relationship between lower levels of serum resistin and increased VD level
category (P=0.013). The KRT10, SEMA3B, SNORD3C, ARSD, and IGKV4-1 genes were
differentially expressed (false discovery rate <0.05) between VDD and non-VDD
subjects. Gene ontology and pathway analysis suggest activation of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-κB pathways in VDD NAFLD
subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: VDD is prevalent among US adult NAFLD patients and is independently 
associated with a definitive diagnosis of NASH and increased histological
severity. Novel associations in proinflammatory pathways were identified, which
suggest the mechanism for VDD in the pathogenesis of NASH and support dietary
and/or lifestyle modifications to increase vitamin D levels in these patients.

Chromosomal rearrangements and fusion genes play important roles in tumor
development and progression. Four high-frequency prostate cancer (CaP) specific
fusion genes, SDK1:AMACR, RAD50:PDLIM4, CTAGE5:KHDRBS3 and USP9Y:TTTY15 have been
reported in Chinese CaP samples through a transcriptome sequencing study. We
previously reported that USP9Y:TTTY15 is a transcription-mediated chimeric RNA,
which is expressed in both tumor and non-malignant samples, and here we attempted
to confirm the existence of the other three fusion genes SDK1:AMACR, RAD50:PDLIM 
and CTAGE5:KHDRBS3. We detected SDK1:AMACR fusion transcript in 23 of 100 Chinese
CaP samples, but did not detect RAD50:PDLIM4 and CTAGE5:KHDRBS3 transcripts in
any of those samples. SDK1:AMACR fusion transcript is Chinese CaP specific, which
was neither detected in non-malignant prostate tissues adjacent to cancer from
Chinese patient nor in CaP samples from UK patients. However, we did not detect
genomic rearrangement of SDK1 gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization
analysis, indicating that SDK1:AMACR is also a transcription-mediated chimeric
RNA. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that high level AMACR expression was
associated with SDK1:AMACR fusion status (P=0.004), suggesting that SDK1:AMACR
fusion transcript may promote prostate carcinogenesis through increasing AMACR
expression. However, the fusion status was not significantly correlated with any 
poor disease progression clinical features. The identification of the SDK1:AMACR 
fusion transcript in CaP cases from China but not from UK further supports our
previous observation that different genetic alterations contribute to CaP in
China and Western countries, although many genetic changes are also shared.
Further studies are required to establish if CaPs with SDK1:AMACR represent a
distinct subtype.

OBJECTIVE: In recent years, great effort has been made to explore new biomarkers 
for early detection of prostate cancer. Our previous study has demonstrated the
high prevalence of TTTY15-USP9Y in prostate cancer samples from a Chinese
population. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical utility of TTTY15-USP9Y in
predicting the prostate biopsy outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined the expression of TTTY15-USP9Y
in 226 qualified urine sediment samples. Total RNA was extracted from the urine
sediment by using TRIzol reagent, and complementary DNA was synthesized using
TransPlex Complete Whole Transcriptome Amplification Kit (WTA2). Real-time
quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate the expression
of TTTY15-USP9Y and the prostate cancer-specific antigen (PSA) level. The
TTTY15-USP9Y score was calculated as 2(Ct(PSA)-Ct(TTTY15-USP9Y))× 1,000.
RESULTS: The TTTY15-USP9Y score was statistically significantly higher in men
with positive biopsy outcome than in men with negative biopsy outcome (P<0.001). 
The area under the curve was 0.828 for the TTTY15-USP9Y score in the entire
patient cohort. The TTTY15-USP9Y score׳s cutoff of 90.28 provided the optimal
balance between sensitivity (84.0%) and specificity (77.5%). The combination of
PSA level and the TTTY15-USP9Y score significantly improved the diagnostic
performance of PSA level (P = 0.001). The TTTY15-USP9Y score alone was superior
to PSA level, percent free PSA, and PSA density (serum PSA/prostate volume) in
the subgroup of clinical interest (PSA level: 4-10ng/ml, gray zone). Univariable 
and multivariable logistic analyses indicated that TTTY15-USP9Y score, PSA level,
age, and prostate volume were independent predictors of PCa. Adding the
TTTY15-USP9Y score in the clinical base model (PSA level, age, and prostate
volume) could bring a higher net benefit and reduce more unnecessary biopsies in 
the defined range of interest (10%-40% threshold probability).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study explored the potential utility of measuring 
the TTTY15-USP9Y score in post-digital rectal examination urine samples to
predict biopsy outcome and provided the basis for the utility of this novel gene 
fusion in multicenter and large cohort studies.

    Cell Res. 2012 May;22(5):786-8.

There are remarkable disparities among patients of different races with prostate 
cancer; however, the mechanism underlying this difference remains unclear. Here, 
we present a comprehensive landscape of the transcriptome profiles of 14 primary 
prostate cancers and their paired normal counterparts from the Chinese population
using RNA-seq, revealing tremendous diversity across prostate cancer
transcriptomes with respect to gene fusions, long noncoding RNAs (long ncRNA),
alternative splicing and somatic mutations. Three of the 14 tumors (21.4%)
harbored a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, and the low prevalence of this fusion in Chinese
patients was further confirmed in an additional tumor set (10/54=18.5%). Notably,
two novel gene fusions, CTAGE5-KHDRBS3 (20/54=37%) and USP9Y-TTTY15
(19/54=35.2%), occurred frequently in our patient cohort. Further systematic
transcriptional profiling identified numerous long ncRNAs that were
differentially expressed in the tumors. An analysis of the correlation between
expression of long ncRNA and genes suggested that long ncRNAs may have functions 
beyond transcriptional regulation. This study yielded new insights into the
pathogenesis of prostate cancer in the Chinese population.

Long non-coding RNAs in Huntington's disease neurodegeneration.

Neurodegeneration in the brains of Huntington's disease patients is accompanied
by widespread changes in gene regulatory networks. Recent studies have found that
these changes are not restricted to protein-coding genes, but also include
non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). One particularly abundant but poorly understood class
of ncRNAs is the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), of which at least ten thousand
have been identified in the human genome. Although we presently know little about
their function, lncRNAs are widely expressed in the mammalian nervous system, and
many are likely to play critical roles in neuronal development and activity.
LncRNAs are now being implicated in neurodegenerative processes, including
Alzheimer's (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD). In the present study, I discuss
the potential significance of lncRNAs in HD. To support this, I have mined
existing microarray data to discover seven new lncRNAs that are dysregulated in
HD brains. Interestingly, several of these contain genomic binding sites for the 
transcriptional repressor REST, a key mediator of transcriptional changes in HD, 
including the known REST target lncRNA, DGCR5. Previously described lncRNAs TUG1 
(necessary for retinal development) and NEAT1 (a structural component of nuclear 
paraspeckles) are upregulated in HD caudate, while the brain-specific
tumour-suppressor MEG3 is downregulated. Three other lncRNAs of unknown function 
are also significantly changed in HD brains. Many lncRNAs regulate gene
expression through formation of epigenetic ribonucleoprotein complexes, including
TUG1 and MEG3. These findings lead me to propose that lncRNA expression changes
in HD are widespread, that many of these result in altered epigenetic gene
regulation in diseased neurons, and that contributes to neurodegeneration.
Therefore, elucidating lncRNA network changes in HD may be important in
understanding and treating this and other neurodegenerative processes.

Regulation of neural macroRNAs by the transcriptional repressor REST.

The essential transcriptional repressor REST (repressor element 1-silencing
transcription factor) plays central roles in development and human disease by
regulating a large cohort of neural genes. These have conventionally fallen into 
the class of known, protein-coding genes; recently, however, several noncoding
microRNA genes were identified as REST targets. Given the widespread
transcription of messenger RNA-like, noncoding RNAs ("macroRNAs"), some of which 
are functional and implicated in disease in mammalian genomes, we sought to
determine whether this class of noncoding RNAs can also be regulated by REST. By 
applying a new, unbiased target gene annotation pipeline to computationally
discovered REST binding sites, we find that 23% of mammalian REST genomic binding
sites are within 10 kb of a macroRNA gene. These putative target genes were
overlooked by previous studies. Focusing on a set of 18 candidate macroRNA
targets from mouse, we experimentally demonstrate that two are regulated by REST 
in neural stem cells. Flanking protein-coding genes are, at most, weakly
repressed, suggesting specific targeting of the macroRNAs by REST. Similar to the
majority of known REST target genes, both of these macroRNAs are induced during
nervous system development and have neurally restricted expression profiles in
adult mouse. We observe a similar phenomenon in human: the DiGeorge
syndrome-associated noncoding RNA, DGCR5, is repressed by REST through a proximal
upstream binding site. Therefore neural macroRNAs represent an additional
component of the REST regulatory network. These macroRNAs are new candidates for 
understanding the role of REST in neuronal development, neurodegeneration, and
cancer.

Genes involved in the RNA interference pathway are differentially expressed
during sea urchin development.

University, Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA. jia_song@brown.edu

RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) is a conserved gene silencing mechanism that
involves double-stranded RNA as a signal to trigger the sequence-specific
degradation of target mRNA, resulting in posttranscriptional silencing and/or
translational repression. Bioinformatic searches in the sea urchin genome
database identified homologs of Drosha, DGCR5, Dicer, TRBP, Exportin-5, and
Argonautes. Quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction indicated that all 
mRNA accumulate in eggs and in variable levels throughout early development.
Whole-mount in situ RNA hybridization showed that all of the important players of
the RNAi silencing pathway have abundant mRNA accumulation in oocytes and eggs,
but have distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns throughout
development. Sequence analysis revealed that each of the four Argonautes examined
contain conserved residues important for RNAseH activity within the Piwi domain. 
This study elucidated that genes involved in the RNAi silencing pathway have
dynamic expression and, thus, may have regulatory roles during germ cell
development and embryogenesis.

Most cases of DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and related abnormalities are associated
with deletions within 22q11. Shortest region of deletion overlap (SRO) mapping
previously identified a critical region (the DGCR) of 500 kb, which was presumed 
to contain a gene or genes of major effect in the haploinsufficiency syndromes.
The DGCR also contains sequences disrupted by a balanced translocation that is
associated with DGS--the ADU breakpoint. We have cloned sequences at the
breakpoint and screened for novel genes in its vicinity. A series of
alternatively spliced transcripts expressed during human and murine
embryogenesis, but with no obvious protein encoding potential, were identified.
The gene encoding these RNAs has been named DGCR5 and it is disrupted by the
patient ADU breakpoint. DGCR5 is distinct from the DGCR3 open reading frame (ORF)
previously shown to be interrupted by the ADU translocation, although DGCR3 is
embedded within a DGCR5 intron and in the same (predicted) transcriptional
orientation. No mutations of DGCR5 have yet been detected. By analogy to other
loci encoding conserved, nontranslated RNAs, it is possible that DGCR5 originates
from a cis-acting transcriptional control element in the vicinity of the ADU/VDU 
breakpoint. Disruption of such an element would result in altered transcription
of neighboring genes secondary to a position effect, a hypothesis in keeping with
recent refinement of the SRO placing the ADU breakpoint outside the DGCR.

Bipolar disorder (BD) shows one of the strongest genetic predispositions among
psychiatric disorders and the identification of reliable genetic predictors of
treatment response could significantly improve the prognosis of the disease. The 
present study investigated genetic predictors of long-term treatment-outcome in
723 patients with BD type I from the STEP-BD (Systematic Treatment Enhancement
Program for Bipolar Disorder) genome-wide dataset. BD I patients with >6months of
follow-up and without any treatment restriction (reflecting a natural setting
scenario) were included. Phenotypes were the total and depressive episode rates
and the occurrence of one or more (hypo)manic/mixed episodes during follow-up.
Quality control of genome-wide data was performed according to standard criteria 
and linear/logistic regression models were used as appropriate under an additive 
hypothesis. Top genes were further analyzed through a pathway analysis. Genes
previously involved in the susceptibility to BD (DFNB31, SORCS2, NRXN1, CNTNAP2, 
GRIN2A, GRM4, GRIN2B), antidepressant action (DEPTOR, CHRNA7, NRXN1), and mood
stabilizer or antipsychotic action (NTRK2, CHRNA7, NRXN1) may affect long-term
treatment outcome of BD. Promising findings without previous strong evidence were
TRAF3IP2-AS1, NFYC, RNLS, KCNJ2, RASGRF1, NTF3 genes. Pathway analysis supported 
particularly the involvement of molecules mediating the positive regulation of
MAPK cascade and learning/memory processes. Further studies focused on the
outlined genes may be helpful to provide validated markers of BD treatment
outcome.

Maintenance of the drug-addicted state is thought to involve changes in gene
expression in different neuronal cell types and neural circuits. Midbrain
dopamine (DA) neurons in particular mediate numerous responses to drugs of abuse.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate CNS gene expression through a variety of
mechanisms, but next to nothing is known about their role in drug abuse. The
proportion of lncRNAs that are primate-specific provides a strong rationale for
their study in human drug abusers. In this study, we determined a profile of
dysregulated putative lncRNAs through the analysis of postmortem human midbrain
specimens from chronic cocaine abusers and well-matched control subjects (n = 11 
in each group) using a custom lncRNA microarray. A dataset comprising 32
well-annotated lncRNAs with independent evidence of brain expression and robust
differential expression in cocaine abusers is presented. For a subset of these
lncRNAs, differential expression was validated by quantitative real-time PCR and 
cellular localization determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry.
Examples of lncRNAs exhibiting DA cell-specific expression, different subcellular
distributions, and covariance of expression with known cocaine-regulated
protein-coding genes were identified. These findings implicate lncRNAs in the
cellular responses of human DA neurons to chronic cocaine abuse. Long noncoding
RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate the expression of protein-coding genes, but little is
known about their potential role in drug abuse. In this study, we identified
lncRNAs differentially expressed in human cocaine abusers' midbrains. One
up-regulated antisense lncRNA, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor
3-interacting protein 2-antisense 1 (TRAF3IP2-AS1), was found predominantly in
the nucleus of human dopamine (DA) neurons, whereas the related TRAF3IP2
protein-coding transcript was distributed throughout these cells. The abundances 
of these transcripts were significantly correlated (left) suggesting that
TRAF3IP2-AS1 may regulate TRAF3IP2 gene expression, perhaps through local
chromatin changes at this locus (right).

OBJECTIVE: To study genome-wide gene expression changes in gastric cancer cells
after iodine-125 ¹²⁵(I) particle irradiation.
METHODS: ¹²⁵I particles were used to irradiate three gastric cancer cell lines of
various differentiation levels:high (BGC-823) , medium (AGS) and low (NCI-N87)
.Whole-genome gene expression was investigated with microarray. The gene
expression in iodine-125 irradiated and untreated cancer cells was compared, and 
the genes with transcript levels altered for at least 2 folds (P < 0.05) were
selected. The change in gene expression levels was verified by using quantitative
real-time (qRT) -PCR.
RESULTS: The three gastric cancer cell lines received the same dose rate of ¹²⁵I 
particle irradiation. Cluster analysis showed that the Gene Ontology (GO)
categories did not change in the three cell lines, but changes in gene expression
levels were evident for many genes. After ¹²⁵I particle irradiate NCI-N87 cells, 
895 genes were up-regulated, 786 genes were down-regulated; AGS was irradiated by
¹²⁵I seed, there were 124 genes upregulated, 161 genes were down-regulated;
BGC-823 cells were treated by ¹²⁵I seed irradiation, 2 412 genes upregulated, 3
243 downregulated genes. After ionizing radiation can cause very complex
transcriptional regulation changes, KEGG pathway analysis shows that these
differentially expressed genes overlap in a particular cell pathway. Four genes, 
TRAF3IP2-AS1, SDC1, RABL2B and NOM, were found having at least 2-fold difference 
in expression (P < 0.05) , and the gene expression alteration was confirmed by
qRT-PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: ¹²⁵I particle irradiation caused gene expression changes in gastric 
cancer cells. The expressions of TRAF3IP2-AS1, SDC1, RABL2B and NOM are altered
significantly in all three cell lines studied, indicating that these genes may
play an important role in the ¹²⁵I seed treatment of gastric cancer. These genes 
could be potential targets for developing anti-cancer drugs in the future.

Two new genes were cloned from region 6q21 and characterized. One gene, C6orf4-6,
expresses three mRNA isoforms diverging at the 5' and 3' ends, and encodes two
protein isoforms that differ by nine amino acids at their amino terminus. The
second gene, C6UAS, is transcribed in the antisense orientation from the
complementary strand of C6orf4-6. C6UAS overlaps the second exon of C6orf4, where
the start codon of protein isoform 1 is located. C6UAS has no apparent ORF and
most likely represents a structural RNA gene that is transcribed but not
translated. This feature and the antisense polarity of transcription suggest that
C6UAS could play a regulatory role on the expression of C6orf4, as indicated by a
significant decrease of endogenous C6orf4 expression after transfection of C6UAS 
cDNA in human fibroblasts. Neither C6UAS nor C6orf4-6 genes show any homology
with known human genes. The two genes were cloned from a subregion at 6q21
containing a replicative senescence gene, a tumor suppressor gene and a gene
involved in hereditary schizophrenia. In addition, the common fragile site FRA6F 
was mapped in the same region. Cloning and characterization of C6orf4-6 and C6UAS
may help to clarify the structure and the functional role of this important
region.

Cardiac hypertrophy (CH) could increase cardiac after-load and lead to heart
failure. Recent studies have suggested that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) played a
crucial role in the process of the cardiac hypertrophy, such as Mhrt, TERMINATOR.
Some studies have further found a new interacting mechanism, competitive
endogenous RNA (ceRNA), of which lncRNA could interact with micro-RNAs (miRNA)
and indirectly interact with mRNAs through competing interactions. However, the
mechanism of ceRNA regulated by lncRNA in the CH remained unclear. In our study, 
we generated a global triple network containing mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA, and
extracted a CH related lncRNA-mRNA network (CHLMN) through integrating the data
from starbase, miRanda database and gene expression profile. Based on the ceRNA
mechanism, we analyzed the characters of CHLMN and found that 3 lncRNAs
(SLC26A4-AS1, RP11-344E13.3 and MAGI1-IT1) were high related to CH. We further
performed cluster module analysis and random walk with restart for the CHLMN,
finally 14 lncRNAs had been discovered as the potential CH related disease genes.
Our results showed that lncRNA played an important role in the CH and could shed 
new light to the understanding underlying mechanisms of the CH.

Breast cancer is diverse in their natural history and in their responsiveness to 
treatments. It is urgent to generate candidate biomarkers for the stratification 
of patients and personalization of therapy to avoid overtreatment or inadequate
treatment. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to be pervasively
transcribed in the genome and played critical roles in cancer progression. A lot 
of lncRNAs have been reported as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets in multiple cancers. In this study, we demonstrated that FGF14 antisense 
RNA 2 (FGF14-AS2), a novel long non-coding RNA, was significantly down-regulated 
in breast cancer tissue compared with adjacent normal tissue both in validated
cohort and TCGA cohort. Reduced expression of FGF14-AS2 was correlated with
larger tumor size, more lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage in both
cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with lower FGF14-AS2
expression had a worse overall survival. Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed
that decreased expression of FGF14-AS2 was an independent predictor of overall
survival. Together, these results suggested that FGF14-AS2 involved in the
progress of breast cancer and might act as a tumor suppressor gene. To the best
of our knowledge, it was firstly reported that FGF14-AS2 was involved in cancer. 
This study provided a potential new marker and a target for gene therapy in
breast cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Asthma is a complex heterogeneous disease process with mild,
moderate, and severe classifications. Although the science of genomics has opened
our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of asthma, epigenetics is
emerging as a mechanism whereby the expression of disease-risk genes may be
influenced by environmental exposure.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to discuss the methodology of data
collection and evaluation involved in genome-wide methylation profiling
(epigenomic) through presentation of data generated for a population presenting
with severe asthma.
METHOD: Over 14,000 gene promoter sites were analyzed for methylation status
among six subjects with severe asthma and four normal controls in this pilot
study. Two duplicate samples were used as technical replicates. Nonsmoking
case/control subjects were chosen based on similar gender and age. Blood samples 
were used for DNA extraction, and methylation data were collected utilizing the
Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27BeadChip platform.
RESULTS: Technical replicates were highly concordant, and statistically
significant differences were found in methylation profiles between subjects with 
severe asthma and normal controls (p < 10(-8)), some previously reported with
pulmonary function and others never before reported. After correction for
multiple testing, three gene promoter regions remained statistically different:
FAM181A, ZNF718, and MRI1.
DISCUSSION: This research supports the internal validity of the Illumina platform
in methylation analysis of DNA from stored blood samples. Although significant
differences in methylation were noted between subjects with severe asthma and
controls, the small sample size warrants further investigation into these
results.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have been shown to play important roles in the
development and progression of cancer. Here, we discovered a novel long noncoding
RNA (lncRNA) FEZF1 antisense RNA1 (FEZF1-AS1) is markedly upregulated in human
primary colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and associated with CRC metastasis and poor
prognosis. Moreover, the downregulation of FEZF1-AS1 expression significantly
inhibited the CRC cells proliferation, migration and invasiveness, suppressed
S-phase entry in vitro, and repressed tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. In
contrast, overexpression of FEZF1-AS1 could promote the aggressive behaviors of
CRC cells. We further discovered that the downregulation of FEZF1-AS1 reduced its
sense-cognate gene FEZF1 mRNA and protein expression in CRC cells. There was a
positive correlation between FEZF1-AS1 and FEZF1 expression in CRC. Moreover,
FEZF1 knockdown also significantly suppressed CRC cell proliferation, migration, 
and invasion. Our findings indicate that the dysregulation of FEZF1-AS1
participates in colorectal tumorigenesis and progression, which might be
achieved, at least in part, through FEZF1 induction.

cAMP/CREB-regulated LINC00473 marks LKB1-inactivated lung cancer and mediates
tumor growth.

Chen Z, Li JL, Lin S, Cao C, Gimbrone NT, Yang R, Fu DA, Carper MB, Haura EB,
Schabath MB, Lu J, Amelio AL, Cress WD, Kaye FJ, Wu L.

The LKB1 tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated and inactivated in non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Loss of LKB1 promotes cancer progression and influences
therapeutic responses in preclinical studies; however, specific targeted
therapies for lung cancer with LKB1 inactivation are currently unavailable. Here,
we have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature that is associated
with the loss of LKB1 function. We discovered that LINC00473 is consistently the 
most highly induced gene in LKB1-inactivated human primary NSCLC samples and
derived cell lines. Elevated LINC00473 expression correlated with poor prognosis,
and sustained LINC00473 expression was required for the growth and survival of
LKB1-inactivated NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, LINC00473 was induced by LKB1
inactivation and subsequent cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein
(CREB)/CREB-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC) activation. We determined 
that LINC00473 is a nuclear lncRNA and interacts with NONO, a component of the
cAMP signaling pathway, thereby facilitating CRTC/CREB-mediated transcription.
Collectively, our study demonstrates that LINC00473 expression potentially serves
as a robust biomarker for tumor LKB1 functional status that can be integrated
into clinical trials for patient selection and treatment evaluation, and
implicates LINC00473 as a therapeutic target for LKB1-inactivated NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Although Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) is the dominant
gastrointestinal pathogen, the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying
H.pylori-related diseases have not been fully elucidated. Long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) have been identified in eukaryotic cells, many of which play important 
roles in regulating biological processes and pathogenesis. However, the
expression changes of lncRNAs in human infected by H.pylori have been rarely
reported. This study aimed to identify the dysregulated lncRNAs in human gastric 
epithelial cells and tissues infected with H.pylori.
METHODS: The aberrant expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in GES-1 cells
with or without H.pylori infection were explored by microarray analysis.
LncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was constructed based on Pearson correlation
analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG Pathway analyses of aberrantly expressed
mRNAs were performed to identify the related biological functions and pathologic 
pathways. The expression changes of target lncRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR to
confirm the microarray data in both cells and clinical specimens.
RESULTS: Three hundred three lncRNAs and 565 mRNAs were identified as aberrantly 
expressed transcripts (≥2 or ≤0.5-fold change, P < 0.05) in cells with H.pylori
infection compared to controls. LncRNA-mRNA co-expression network showed the core
lncRNAs/mRNAs which might play important roles in H.pylori-related pathogenesis. 
GO and KEGG analyses have indicated that the functions of aberrantly expressed
mRNAs in H.pylori infection were related closely with inflammation and
carcinogenesis. QRT-PCR data confirmed the expression pattern of 8 (n345630,
XLOC_004787, n378726, LINC00473, XLOC_005517, LINC00152, XLOC_13370, and n408024)
lncRNAs in infected cells. Additionally, four down-regulated (n345630,
XLOC_004787, n378726, and LINC00473) lncRNAs were verified in H.pylori-positive
gastric samples.
CONCLUSION: Our study provided a preliminary exploration of lncRNAs expression
profiles in H.pylori-infected cells by microarray. These dysregulated lncRNAs
might contribute to the pathological processes during H.pylori infection.

Recently, more and more studies show that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a
very important role in various biological processes. However, research on lncRNA 
in the tumor cell drug resistance of it is seldom reported. In this study,
gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cell line SWl990/GZ was obtained by
treating parental cell line SWl990 in vitro with increasing dosage of gemcitabine
in culture medium intermittently for ten months. We identified 4983 of 13310
detected lncRNAs demonstrated > 2-fold abnormally expressed in response to the
gemcitabine-resistant, among of them, 1993 and 2990 lncRNAs were upregulated and 
downregulated. Meanwhile, 4759 mRNAs exhibited at least a 2-fold, of these, 2671 
and 2088 mRNAs were upregulated and downregulated. Gene Ontology analysis and
Pathway analysis revealed that differential expression mRNA involved in
significant biological regulatory function and some genes may be particular to
pancreatic cancer chemotherapy resistance. Quantitative real time PCR confirmed
the changes of six lncRNAs (RP11-58D2.1, lincRNA-ZNF532, AP000221.1,
CTC-338M12.5, CR619813, DDX6P) and nine mRNAs (SYT1, FAM171B, ZNF331, FAM187B,
CYP1A1, SRXN1, HIST1H2BL, TOMM40L and SPP1) in SW1990 and SW1990/GZ. We also
found that the upregulating of gemcitabine on the expression of lincRNA-ZNF532
was time-dependent. Gemcitabine at a range from 1.0 μM to 16.0 μM induced a
increase of lincRNA-ZNF532 in SW1990 cells. The relative level of DDX6P is
opposite to that of lincRNA-ZNF53 in the same circumstance. In conclusion, the
dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs identified in this work may represent good
candidates for future diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic
targets.

Biosensors using live cells are analytical devices that have the advantage of
being highly sensitive for their targets. Although attention has primarily
focused on reporter gene assays using functional promoters, cell viability assays
are still efficient. We focus on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are involved
in the molecular mechanisms associated with responses to cellular stresses as a
new biological material. Here we have developed human live cells transfected with
lncRNAs that can be used as an intelligent sensor of cytotoxicity for a broad
range of environmental stresses. We identified three lncRNAs (GAS5, IDI2-AS1, and
SNHG15) that responded to cycloheximide in HEK293 cells. Overexpression of these 
lncRNAs sensitized human cells to cell death in response to various stresses
(cycloheximide, ultraviolet irradiation, mercury II chloride, or hydrogen
peroxide). In particular, dual lncRNA (GAS5 plus IDI2-AS1, or GAS5 plus SNHG15)
overexpression sensitized cells to cell death by more cellular stresses. We
propose a method for highly sensitive biosensors using overexpression of lncRNAs 
that can potentially measure the cytotoxicity signals of various environmental
stresses.

Abiotic and biotic stressors in human cells are often a result of sudden and/or
frequent changes in environmental factors. The molecular response to stress
involves elaborate modulation of gene expression and is of homeostatic,
ecological, and evolutionary importance. Although attention has primarily focused
on signaling pathways and protein networks, long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are
increasingly involved in the molecular mechanisms associated with responses to
cellular stresses. We identified six novel short-lived long ncRNAs (MIR22HG,
GABPB-AS1, LINC00152, IDI2-AS1, SNHG15, and FLJ33630) that responded to chemical 
stressors (cisplatin, cycloheximide, and mercury (II) oxide) in HeLa Tet-off
cells. Our results indicate that short-lived long ncRNAs respond to general and
specific chemical stressors. The expression levels of the short-lived long ncRNAs
were elevated because of prolonged decay rates in response to chemical stressors 
and interruption of RNA degradation pathways. We propose that these long ncRNAs
have the potential to be surrogate indicators of cellular stress responses.

clinical significance.

Researchers have recently demonstrated the key role of long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) in regulating embryogenesis and gene expression. However, the exact
mechanism used by lncRNAs in carcinogenesis is still unclear. In particular,
studies regarding the role of lncRNAs in vulvar squamous cell carcinomas (VSCCs) 
are limited. Using microarray analysis, the genome-wide expression profile of
lncRNAs was investigated in four paired VSCCs and adjacent normal vulvar tissues.
Accordingly, several novel lncRNA candidates (HOAIR, MALAT1, MEG3, NEAT1, MIR31HG
and LINC00478) were chosen for further study and real-time reverse transcription 
PCR (RT-PCR) was used to confirm the expression levels among 35 tissue samples. A
panel of dysregulated lncRNAs (MEG3 and MALAT1) were also identified as potential
biomarkers as they also correlated with VSCC carcinogenesis. In summary, the
results revealed that aberrantly expressed lncRNAs may be a factor in VSCC
pathogenesis, potentially providing new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for
VSCC.

Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong, China.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined the relationships between the expression
level of long non-coding RNA MIR31HG in bladder cancer and the clinical
characteristics.
METHODS: A total of 55 tissue samples from patients with bladder cancer were
collected, and the lncRNA MIR31HG levels in cancer, paired non-cancer tissues and
BC cell lines were detected by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The
relationships between MIR31HG level and the clinical characteristics were
evaluated.
RESULTS: MIR31HG expression was remarkably decreased in bladder cancer tissues
compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues (P < 0.05). MIR31HG expression was
also significantly down-regulated in four bladder cancer cell lines (P < 0.001). 
Clinicopathologic analysis revealed that MIR31HG expression was negatively
associated with TNM stage (P = 0.010), but not with other clinicopathological
characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings revealed that MIR31HG may function as a
cancer-suppressor gene to participate in the bladder cancer carcinogenesis and
development.

Glioblastomas (GBMs) are deadly tumors of the central nervous system. Most GBM
exhibit homozygous deletions of the CDKN2A and CDKN2B tumor suppressors at
9p21.3, although loss of CDKN2A/B alone is insufficient to drive gliomagenesis.
MIR31HG, which encodes microRNA-31 (miR-31), is a novel non-coding tumor
suppressor positioned adjacent to CDKN2A/B at 9p21.3. We have determined that
miR-31 expression is compromised in >72% of all GBM, and for patients, this
predicts significantly shortened survival times independent of CDKN2A/B status.
We show that miR-31 inhibits NF-κB signaling by targeting TRADD, its upstream
activator. Moreover, upon reintroduction, miR-31 significantly reduces tumor
burden and lengthens survival times in animal models. As such, our work
identifies loss of miR-31 as a novel non-coding tumor-driving event in GBM.

Childhood fractures are common, with the forearm being the most common site.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 60 loci
associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in adults but less is known about
genetic influences specific to bone in childhood. To identify novel genetic
factors that influence pediatric bone strength at a common site for childhood
fractures, we performed a sex-stratified trans-ethnic genome-wide association
study of areal BMD (aBMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) Z-scores measured by
dual energy X-ray absorptiometry at the one-third distal radius, in a cohort of
1399 children without clinical abnormalities in bone health. We tested signals
with P < 5 × 10(-6) for replication in an independent, same-age cohort of 486
Caucasian children. Two loci yielded a genome-wide significant combined P-value: 
rs7797976 within CPED1 in females [P = 2.4 × 10(-11), β =- 0.30 standard
deviations (SD) per T allele; aBMD-Z] and rs7035284 at 9p21.3 in males (P = 1.2 ×
10(-8), β = 0.28 SD per G allele; BMC-Z). Signals at the CPED1-WNT16-FAM3C locus 
have been previously associated with BMD at other skeletal sites in adults and
children. Our result at the distal radius underscores the importance of this
locus at multiple skeletal sites. The 9p21.3 locus is within a gene desert, with 
the nearest gene flanking each side being MIR31HG and MTAP, neither of which has 
been implicated in BMD or BMC previously. These findings suggest that genetic
determinants of childhood bone accretion at the radius, a skeletal site that is
primarily cortical bone, exist and also differ by sex.

Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) can occur in response to oncogenic insults and 
is considered an important tumour suppressor mechanism. Here we identify the
lncRNA MIR31HG as upregulated in OIS and find that knockdown of MIR31HG promotes 
a strong p16(INK4A)-dependent senescence phenotype. Under normal conditions,
MIR31HG is found in both nucleus and cytoplasm, but following B-RAF expression
MIR31HG is located mainly in the cytoplasm. We show that MIR31HG interacts with
both INK4A and MIR31HG genomic regions and with Polycomb group (PcG) proteins,
and that MIR31HG is required for PcG-mediated repression of the INK4A locus. We
further identify a functional enhancer, located between MIR31HG and INK4A, which 
becomes activated during OIS and interacts with the MIR31HG promoter. Data from
melanoma patients show a negative correlation between MIR31HG and p16(INK4A)
expression levels, suggesting a role for this transcript in cancer. Hence, our
data provide a new lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism for the tumour suppressor
p16(INK4A).

Practical implications of integrated glioma classification according to the World
Health Organization classification of tumors of the central nervous system 2016.

Author information:

Consortium (DKTK), partner site Essen/Düsseldorf, Germany.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Morphological features identifiable by light microscopy have
been the basis of brain tumor diagnostics for many decades. The revised WHO
classification of tumors of the central nervous system 2016 combines histological
and molecular features for an integrated classification. This new approach builds
upon advances in brain tumor molecular genetics and has important practical
implications.
RECENT FINDINGS: Molecular genetic studies revealed distinct glioma entities with
specific genetic and epigenetic profiles. Evidence has been accumulated that
molecular classification more reliably discriminates glioma entities and better
predicts patient outcome than histological classification. Major glioma entities 
can be distinguished by four molecular biomarkers included in the new WHO
classification, namely isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation, codeletion of
chromosome arms 1p and 19q, codon 27 lysine-to-methionine mutation in H3
histones, and C11orf95-RELA gene fusions. Each is detectable by common techniques
in routinely processed tissue specimens. Their integration into glioma
classification greatly improves diagnostic accuracy but also has practical
implications concerning establishment and quality control of novel techniques,
increased costs and prolonged time to diagnosis.
SUMMARY: We summarize the relevant changes in the revised WHO classification of
gliomas, outline the integrated approach, and discuss its practical implications 
and potential challenges.

Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor (AT/RT) Arising From Ependymoma: A Type of AT/RT
Secondarily Developing From Other Primary Central Nervous System Tumors.

Y, Yokoo H.

Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) are rare, aggressive, embryonal brain
tumors that occur most frequently in very young children; they are characterized 
by rhabdoid cells and loss of INI1 protein nuclear expression. Here, we report
the case of a 24-year-old man with a left frontal lobe tumor that was composed
mainly of rhabdoid cells showing loss of INI1 nuclear reactivity and
polyphenotypic immunohistochemical expression, with a small INI1-positive
component of ependymoma. Array comparative genomic hybridization separately
conducted for each histologically distinct component revealed 22 shared identical
copy number alterations, including loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 22q
containing the INI1 locus. Furthermore, we found the C11orf95-RELA fusion gene,
the genetic hallmark of supratentorial ependymomas, not only in the ependymoma
component but also in the AT/RT component by fluorescence in situ hybridization
analysis, suggesting that the AT/RT cells secondarily progressed from the
preexisting ependymoma cells. A second genetic inactivating event in the INI1
gene was not detected in the AT/RT component. There are several reported cases of
AT/RT (or INI1-negative rhabdoid tumors) arising in the setting of other primary 
brain tumors (gangliogliomas, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, and high-grade
gliomas), but the present case

The diagnostic subdivision of gliomas is traditionally based on histological
features as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of
tumors of the central nervous system. In recent years molecular studies have
identified a number of genetic and epigenetic markers that could contribute to an
improved tumor classification and better prediction of response to therapy and
prognosis in the individual patient. The most important molecular tests with
differential diagnostic relevance in patients with astrocytic and
oligodendroglial tumors include the detection of genetic mutations in the
isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), IDH2, alpha thalassemia/mental retardation
syndrome X-linked (ATRX), histone H3.3 (H3F3A) and v-raf murine sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog B (BRAF) genes as well as the demonstration of codeletions of
chromosomal arms 1p and 19q. Important predictive markers that have been linked
to the response to alkylating chemotherapy are O-6-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation in glioblastoma patients and 1p/19q
codel status in anaplastic glioma patients. Oncogenic c11orf95/RELA fusion gene
formation is characteristic for a subgroup of patients with supratentorial
ependymoma. In addition to diagnostic testing of individual genes, novel
microarray and next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques show promising
perspectives in glioma diagnostics. The assessment of DNA methylation profiles
using DNA methylation arrays representing 450,000 CpG dinucleotides distributed
throughout the human genome (450 k array test) now allows the robust molecular
classification of gliomas into clinically relevant entities and variants.
Moreover, glioma-associated gene panel NGS promises the timely parallel
sequencing of relevant diagnostic and predictive marker genes in a single test.
It will now be a major task to integrate these novel results and techniques into 
the conventional histological procedures in the up-coming revision of the WHO
classification.

Ependymomas are rare glial tumors of the central nervous system that arise from
the cells lining the ventricles and central canal within the spinal cord. The
distribution of these tumors along the neuroaxis varies by age, most commonly
involving the spinal cord in adults and the posterior fossa in children. It is
becoming evident that ependymomas of infratentorial, supratentorial, and spinal
cord location are genetically distinct which may explain the differences in
clinical outcomes. A novel oncogenic fusion involving the C11orf95 and RELA genes
was recently described in supratentorial ependymomas that results in constitutive
aberrant activation of the nuclear factor-kB signaling pathway. Ependymosarcomas 
are rare neoplasms in which a malignant mesenchymal component arises within an
ependymoma. We here describe a case of a sarcoma developing in a patient
previously treated with chemotherapy and radiation whose original ependymoma and 
recurrent sarcoma were both shown to carry the type 1 C11orf95-RELA fusion
transcript indicating a monoclonal origin for both tumors.

Molecular genetics of ependymomas and pediatric diffuse gliomas: a short review.

Here, we review the recent literature on molecular discoveries in ependymomas and
pediatric diffuse gliomas. Ependymomas can now be categorized into three
location-related subgroups according to their biological profile: posterior fossa
ependymomas, group A (PFA) and B (PFB), and supratentorial ependymomas. Although 
no recurrently mutated genes were found throughout these groups of ependymomas,
PFA exhibited a CpG island methylator phenotype, PFB was associated with
extensive chromosomal aberrations, and the C11orf95-RELA fusion gene was
frequently observed in supratentorial ependymomas. Meanwhile, it has now become
apparent that pediatric diffuse gliomas have a distinct genetic status from their
adult counterparts, even though they share an indistinguishable histology. In
pediatric low-grade diffuse gliomas, an intragenic duplication of the portion of 
FGFR1 encoding the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) and rearrangements of MYB/MYBL1
were found recurrently and mutually exclusively. As for non-brainstem high-grade 
tumors, in addition to H3F3A, TP53, and ATRX mutations, which were frequently
observed in older children, recurrent fusions involving NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3
were reported in infants younger than 3 years of age. Moreover, in diffuse
intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG), recurrent somatic mutations of ACVR1 were found
in association with HIST1H3B mutations.

Members of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) family of transcriptional regulators are
central mediators of the cellular inflammatory response. Although constitutive
NF-κB signalling is present in most human tumours, mutations in pathway members
are rare, complicating efforts to understand and block aberrant NF-κB activity in
cancer. Here we show that more than two-thirds of supratentorial ependymomas
contain oncogenic fusions between RELA, the principal effector of canonical NF-κB
signalling, and an uncharacterized gene, C11orf95. In each case, C11orf95-RELA
fusions resulted from chromothripsis involving chromosome 11q13.1. C11orf95-RELA 
fusion proteins translocated spontaneously to the nucleus to activate NF-κB
target genes, and rapidly transformed neural stem cells--the cell of origin of
ependymoma--to form these tumours in mice. Our data identify a highly recurrent
genetic alteration of RELA in human cancer, and the C11orf95-RELA fusion protein 
as a potential therapeutic target in supratentorial ependymoma.

AIMS: Chondroid lipomas are benign adipose tissue tumours. Their rarity and
peculiar morphology can lead to misinterpretation, especially in small biopsies. 
Based on a recurrent translocation t(11;16)(q13;p13), the C11orf95-MKL2 fusion
gene has been found in a few cases. Therefore, it seemed appropriate to look for 
this fusion gene in a larger cohort.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe eight further cases from four females and four
males with an age range of 21-81 years (median 49 years). The tumours were
situated in the lower arm (three), lower leg (two), thigh (one), back (one) and
head (one); seven lesions were deep-seated and one was located subcutaneously.
Sizes ranged from 3 to 12 cm (median 6.3 cm). All patients were treated by simple
excision, and follow-up, available for six patients (range 2 months-12 years;
median 15 months), demonstrated recurrence in one case. Histologically, the
circumscribed and lobulated tumours showed a variable composition of adipocytes, 
lipoblasts, hibernoma-like cells and chondroblast-like cells embedded in a
chondroid matrix. Immunohistochemistry, performed in four cases, revealed
positivity for S-100 and pancytokeratin in two of three neoplasms stained for
each marker. A C11orf95-MKL2 fusion gene was shown by RT-PCR analysis in seven of
the eight cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Molecular analysis can be used to support the diagnosis of chondroid
lipoma, especially in small samples. This may be helpful in planning treatment
when the differential diagnosis includes malignant lesions.

adipocytic tumors.

Over the last 20 years, a number of tumor-specific chromosomal translocations and
associated fusion genes have been identified for mesenchymal neoplasms including 
adipocytic tumors. The addition of molecular cytogenetic techniques, especially
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), has further enhanced the sensitivity
and accuracy of detecting nonrandom chromosomal translocations and/or other
rearrangements in adipocytic tumors. Indeed, most resent molecular cytogenetic
analysis has demonstrated a translocation t(11;16)(q13;p13) that produces a
C11orf95-MKL2 fusion gene in chondroid lipoma. Additionally, it is well
recognized that supernumerary ring and/or giant rod chromosomes are
characteristic for atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma and 
dedifferentiated liposarcoma, and amplification of 12q13-15 involving the MDM2,
CDK4, and CPM genes is shown by FISH in these tumors. Moreover, myxoid/round cell
liposarcoma is characterized by a translocation t(12;16)(q13;p11) that fuses the 
DDIT3 and FUS genes. This paper provides an overview of the role of conventional 
cytogenetics and molecular cytogenetics in the diagnosis of adipocytic tumors.

Chondroid lipoma, a rare benign adipose tissue tumor, may histologically resemble
myxoid liposarcoma or extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, but is genetically
distinct. In this study, an identical reciprocal translocation,
t(11;16)(q13;p13), was identified in three chondroid lipomas, a finding
consistent with previously isolated reports. A fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH)-based positional cloning strategy using a series of bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) probe combinations designed to narrow the 16p13 breakpoint
revealed MKL2 as the candidate gene. Subsequent 5' RACE studies demonstrated
C11orf95 as the MKL2 fusion gene partner. MKL/myocardin-like 2 (MKL2) encodes
myocardin-related transcription factor B in a megakaryoblastic leukemia gene
family, and C11orf95 (chromosome 11 open reading frame 95) is a hypothetical
protein. Sequencing analysis of reverse transcription-polymerse chain reaction
(RT-PCR) generated transcripts from all three chondroid lipomas defined the
fusion as occurring between exons 5 and 9 of C11orf95 and MKL2, respectively.
Dual-color breakpoint spanning probe sets custom-designed for recognition of the 
translocation event in interphase cells confirmed the anticipated rearrangements 
of the C11orf95 and MKL2 loci in all cases. The FISH and RT-PCR assays developed 
in this study can serve as diagnostic adjuncts for the identification of this
novel C11orf95-MKL2 fusion oncogene in chondroid lipoma.

Current evidence suggests a multifactorial etiology to pelvic organ prolapse
(POP), including genetic predisposition. We conducted a genome-wide association
study of POP in African American (AA) and Hispanic (HP) women from the Women's
Health Initiative Hormone Therapy study. Cases were defined as any POP (grades
1-3) or moderate/severe POP (grades 2-3), while controls had grade 0 POP. We
performed race-specific multiple logistic regression analyses between SNPs
imputed to 1000 genomes in relation to POP (grade 0 vs 1-3; grade 0 vs 2-3)
adjusting for age at diagnosis, body mass index, parity, and genetic ancestry.
There were 1274 controls and 1427 cases of any POP and 317 cases of
moderate/severe POP. Although none of the analyses reached genome-wide
significance (p<5x10-8), we noted variants in several loci that met p<10-6. In
race-specific analysis of grade 0 vs 2-3, intronic SNPs in the CPE gene
(rs28573326, OR:2.14; 95% CI 1.62-2.83; p = 1.0x10-7) were associated with POP in
AAs, and SNPs in the gene AL132709.5 (rs1950626, OR:2.96; 95% CI 1.96-4.48, p =
2.6x10-7) were associated with POP in HPs. Inverse variance fixed-effect
meta-analysis of the race-specific results showed suggestive signals for SNPs in 
the DPP6 gene (rs11243354, OR:1.36; p = 4.2x10-7) in the grade 0 vs 1-3 analyses 
and for SNPs around PGBD5 (rs740494, OR:2.17; p = 8.6x10-7) and SHC3 (rs2209875, 
OR:0.60; p = 9.3x10-7) in the grade 0 vs 2-3 analyses. While we did not identify 
genome-wide significant findings, we document several SNPs reaching suggestive
statistical significance. Further interrogation of POP in larger minority samples
is warranted.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-proten-coding transcripts of more than 200 
nucleotides generated by RNA polymerase II and their expressions are tightly
regulated in cell type specific- and/or cellular differential stage specific-
manner. MIAT, originally isolated as a candidate gene for myocardial infarction, 
encodes lncRNA (termed MIAT). Here, we determined the expression level of MIAT in
established leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and found its upregulation in lymphoid
but not in myeloid cell lineage with mature B cell phenotype. MIAT expression
level was further determined in chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL),
characterized by expansion of leukemic cells with mature B phenotype, to
demonstrate relatively high occurrence of MIAT upregulation in aggressive form of
CLL carrying either 17p-deletion, 11q-deletion, or Trisomy 12 over indolent form 
carrying 13p-deletion. Furthermore, we show that MIAT constitutes a regulatory
loop with OCT4 in malignant mature B cell, as was previously reported in mouse
pulripotent stem cell, and that both molecules are essential for cell survival.

Gene expression is known to be the principle factor explaining how fast genes
evolve. Highly transcribed genes evolve slowly because any negative impact caused
by a particular mutation is magnified by protein abundance. However, gene
expression is a phenotype that depends both on the environment and on the strains
or species. We studied this phenotypic plasticity by analyzing the transcriptome 
profiles of four Escherichia coli strains grown in three different culture media,
and explored how expression variability was linked to gene allelic diversity.
Genes whose expression changed according to the media and not to the strains were
less polymorphic than other genes. Genes for which transcription depended
predominantly on the strain were more polymorphic than other genes and were
involved in sensing and responding to environmental changes, with an
overrepresentation of two-component system genes. Surprisingly, we found that the
correlation between transcription and gene diversity was highly variable among
growth conditions and could be used to quantify growth efficiency of a strain in 
a medium. Genetic variability was found to increase with gene expression in poor 
growth conditions. As such conditions are also characterized by down-regulation
of all DNA repair systems, including transcription-coupled repair, we suggest
that gene expression under stressful conditions may be mutagenic and thus leads
to a variability in mutation rate among genes in the genome which contributes to 
the pattern of protein evolution.

The long noncoding RNA Gomafu/MIAT/Rncr2 is thought to function in retinal cell
specification, stem cell differentiation and the control of alternative splicing.
To further investigate physiological functions of Gomafu, we created mouse
knockout (KO) model that completely lacks the Gomafu gene. The KO mice did not
exhibit any developmental deficits. However, behavioral tests revealed that the
KO mice are hyperactive. This hyperactive behavior was enhanced when the KO mice 
were treated with the psychostimulant methamphetamine, which was associated with 
an increase in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. RNA sequencing analyses
identified a small number of genes affected by the deficiency of Gomafu, a subset
of which are known to have important neurobiological functions. These
observations suggest that Gomafu modifies mouse behavior thorough a mild
modulation of gene expression and/or alternative splicing of target genes.

With more than 30,000 species, ray-finned fish represent approximately half of
vertebrates. The evolution of ray-finned fish was impacted by several whole
genome duplication (WGD) events including a teleost-specific WGD event (TGD) that
occurred at the root of the teleost lineage about 350 million years ago (Mya) and
more recent WGD events in salmonids, carps, suckers and others. In plants and
animals, WGD events are associated with adaptive radiations and evolutionary
innovations. WGD-spurred innovation may be especially relevant in the case of
teleost fish, which colonized a wide diversity of habitats on earth, including
many extreme environments. Fish biodiversity, the use of fish models for human
medicine and ecological studies, and the importance of fish in human nutrition,
fuel an important need for the characterization of gene expression repertoires
and corresponding evolutionary histories of ray-finned fish genes. To this aim,
we performed transcriptome analyses and developed the PhyloFish database to
provide (i) de novo assembled gene repertoires in 23 different ray-finned fish
species including two holosteans (i.e. a group that diverged from teleosts before
TGD) and 21 teleosts (including six salmonids), and (ii) gene expression levels
in ten different tissues and organs (and embryos for many) in the same species.
This resource was generated using a common deep RNA sequencing protocol to obtain
the most exhaustive gene repertoire possible in each species that allows
between-species comparisons to study the evolution of gene expression in
different lineages. The PhyloFish database described here can be accessed and
searched using RNAbrowse, a simple and efficient solution to give access to
RNA-seq de novo assembled transcripts.

Recent studies suggest that the majority of the human genome is transcribed, but 
only about 2% accounts for protein-coding exons. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)
constitute a heterogenic class of RNAs that includes, for example, intergenic
lncRNAs, antisense transcripts, and enhancer RNAs. Moreover, alternative splicing
can lead to the formation of circular RNAs. In support of putative functions,
GWAS for cardiovascular diseases have shown predictive single-nucleotide
polymorphisms in lncRNAs, such as the 9p21 susceptibility locus that encodes the 
lncRNA antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL). Many lncRNAs are
regulated during disease. For example, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma 
transcript 1 (MALAT1) and myocardial infarction-associated transcript (MIAT) were
shown to affect endothelial cell functions and diabetic retinopathy, whereas
lincRNA-p21 controls neointima formation. In the heart, several lncRNAs were
shown to act as microRNA sponges and to control ischemia-reperfusion injury or
act as epigenetic regulators. In this review, the authors summarize the current
understanding of lncRNA functions and their role as biomarkers in cardiovascular 
diseases.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) modulate gene expression at the epigenetic,
transcriptional, and posttranscriptional levels. Dysregulation of the lncRNA
known as myocardial infarction-associated transcript (MIAT) has been associated
with myocardial infarction. Chagas disease causes a severe inflammatory dilated
chronic cardiomyopathy (CCC). We investigated the role of MIAT in CCC. A
whole-transcriptome analysis of heart biopsy specimens and formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded samples revealed that MIAT was overexpressed in patients with
CCC, compared with subjects with noninflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy and
controls. These results were confirmed in a mouse model. Results suggest that
MIAT is a specific biomarker of CCC.

Non-coding RNAs are emerging as regulatory RNAs that participate in the
regulation of gene expression and play vital roles in various biological and
pathological processes. Long non-coding (lncRNA) is a novel class of non-coding
RNAs that regulates gene expression by binding to chromatin regulators and
interfering RNAs to affect cellular response. Myocardial infarction associated
transcript (MIAT) is identified as lncRNAs, which is involved in various
diseases, pathological and physiological processes, such as myocardial
infarction, diabetic retinopathy, paranoid schizophrenia, microvascular
dysfunction and formation of nuclear bodies, and neurogenic commitment. Here we
review the growing understanding and potential utilization of MIAT.

BACKGROUND: HPA axis plays a major role in physiological homeostasis. It is also 
involved in stress and adaptive response to the environment. In farm animals in
general and specifically in pigs, breeding strategies have highly favored
production traits such as lean growth rate, feed efficiency and prolificacy at
the cost of robustness. On the hypothesis that the HPA axis could contribute to
the trade-off between robustness and production traits, we have designed this
experiment to explore individual variation in the biological response to the main
stress hormone, cortisol, in pigs. We used ACTH injections to trigger production 
of cortisol in 120 juvenile Large White (LW) pigs from 28 litters and the
kinetics of the response was measured with biological variables and whole blood
gene expression at 4 time points. A multilevel statistical analysis was used to
take into account the longitudinal aspect of the data.
RESULTS: Cortisol level reached its peak 1 h after ACTH injection. White blood
cell composition was modified with a decrease of lymphocytes and monocytes and an
increase of granulocytes (F D R<0.05). Basal level of cortisol was correlated
with birth and weaning weights. Microarray analysis identified 65 unique genes of
which expression responded to the injection of ACTH (adjusted P<0.05). These
genes were classified into 4 clusters with distinctive kinetics in response to
ACTH injection. The first cluster identified genes strongly correlated to
cortisol and previously reported as being regulated by glucocorticoids. In
particular, DDIT4, DUSP1, FKBP5, IL7R, NFKBIA, PER1, RGS2 and RHOB were shown to 
be connected to each other by the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1. Most of the
differentially expressed genes that encode transcription factors have not been
described yet as being important in transcription networks involved in stress
response. Their co-expression may mean co-regulation and they could thus provide 
new patterns of biomarkers of the individual sensitivity to cortisol.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified 65 genes as biological markers of HPA axis activation 
at the gene expression level. These genes might be candidates for a better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the stress response.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute a novel class
of non-coding RNAs that take part in occurrence and development of diabetes
complication via regulating gene expression. However, litter is known about
lncRNAs in the setting of diabetes induced nephropathy. The aim of this study was
to examine whether lncRNA-myocardial infarction-associated transcript (MIAT) is
involved in diabetes induced renal tubules injury.
METHODS: Adult Wister rats were randomly assigned to receive intraperitoneal STZ 
(65 mg/kg) to induce diabetes. Rats treated with equal volume of citrate buffer
were as control. Renal function was evaluated by analysis of serum creatinine and
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) every four weeks after STZ administration. Also tubules
of all rats were collected for determination of MIAT and Nrf2 level at the
corresponding phase. The in vitro high glucose-triggered human renal tubular
epithelial cell line (HK-2) was used to explore the mechanism underling MIAT
regulated high glucose-induced tubular damage.
RESULTS: In diabetic rats, MIAT showed the lower level and its expression is
negatively correlated with serum creatinine and BUN. Consistent with diabetic
rat, exposed to high glucose, HK-2 cells expressed lower level of MIAT and Nrf2, 
and also showed reduction in cell viability. By pcDNA-MIAT plasmid transfection, 
we observed that MIAT overexpression reversed inhibitory action of Nrf2
expression by high glucose. Moreover, the data of RNA pull-down and RIP showed
that MIAT controlled Nrf2 cellular through enhancing Nrf2 stability, which was
confirmed by CHX and MG132 administration. Inhibitory effect of cell viability by
silencing MIAT was also reversed by Nrf2 overexpression.
CONCLUSION: In summary, our data suggested that MIAT/Nrf2 served as an important 
signaling pathway for high glucose induced renal tubular epithelial injury.

Transcripts in platelets are largely produced in precursor megakaryocytes but
remain physiologically active as platelets translate RNAs and regulate
protein/RNA levels. Recent studies using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq)
characterized the platelet transcriptome in limited number of non-diseased
individuals. Here, we expand upon these RNA-seq studies by completing RNA-seq in 
platelets from 32 patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). Our goals were 
to characterize the platelet transcriptome using a population of patients with
acute MI and relate gene expression to platelet aggregation measures and
ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) (n = 16) vs. non-STEMI (NSTEMI) (n = 16)
subtypes. Similar to other studies, we detected 9565 expressed transcripts,
including several known platelet-enriched markers (e.g. PPBP, OST4). Our RNA-seq 
data strongly correlated with independently ascertained platelet expression data 
and showed enrichment for platelet-related pathways (e.g. wound response,
hemostasis, and platelet activation), as well as actin-related and
post-transcriptional processes. Several transcripts displayed suggestively higher
(FBXL4, ECHDC3, KCNE1, TAOK2, AURKB, ERG, and FKBP5) and lower (MIAT, PVRL3, and 
PZP) expression in STEMI platelets compared to NSTEMI. We also identified
transcripts correlated with platelet aggregation to TRAP (ATP6V1G2, SLC2A3),
collagen (CEACAM1, ITGA2), and ADP (PDGFB, PDGFC, ST3GAL6). Our study adds to
current platelet gene expression resources by providing transcriptome-wide
analyses in platelets isolated from patients with acute MI. In concert with prior
studies, we identify various genes for further study in regards to platelet
function and acute MI. Future platelet RNA-seq studies examining more diverse
sets of healthy and diseased samples will add to our understanding of platelet
thrombotic and non-thrombotic functions.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression by acting with microRNAs
(miRNAs). However, the roles of cancer specific lncRNA and its related
competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) network in hepatocellular cell carcinoma
(HCC) are not fully understood. The lncRNA profiles in 372 HCC patients,
including 372 tumor and 48 adjacent non-tumor liver tissues, from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) and NCBI GEO omnibus (GSE65485) were analyzed. Cancer
specific lncRNAs (or HCC related lncRNAs) were identified and correlated with
clinical features. Based on bioinformatics generated from miRcode, starBase, and 
miRTarBase, we constructed an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network (ceRNA network) in HCC.
We found 177 cancer specific lncRNAs in HCC (fold change ≥ 1.5, P < 0.01), 41 of 
them were also discriminatively expressed with gender, race, tumor grade, AJCC
tumor stage, and AJCC TNM staging system. Six lncRNAs (CECR7, LINC00346,
MAPKAPK5-AS1, LOC338651, FLJ90757, and LOC283663) were found to be significantly 
associated with overall survival (OS, log-rank P < 0.05). Collectively, our
results showed the lncRNA expression patterns and a complex ceRNA network in HCC,
and identified a complex cancer specific ceRNA network, which includes 14 lncRNAs
and 17 miRNAs in HCC.

Prenatal diagnosis and molecular cytogenetic characterization of mosaicism for a 
small supernumerary marker chromosome derived from chromosome 22 associated with 
cat eye syndrome.

We present prenatal diagnosis of mosaicism for a small supernumerary marker
chromosome (sSMC) derived from chromosome 22 associated with cat eye syndrome
(CES) using cultured amniocytes in a pregnancy with fetal microcephaly,
intrauterine growth restriction, left renal hypoplasia, total anomalous pulmonary
venous return with dominant right heart and right ear deformity. The sSMC was
bisatellited and dicentric, and was characterized by multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification (MLPA) and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).
The SALSA MLPA P250-B1 DiGeorge Probemix showed duplication of gene dosage in the
CES region. aCGH showed a 1.26-Mb duplication at 22q11.1-q11.21 encompassing
CECR1-CECR7. The sSMC was likely inv dup(22) (q11.21). Prenatal diagnosis of an
sSMC(22) at amniocentesis should alert CES. MLPA, aCGH and fetal ultrasound are
useful for rapid diagnosis of CES in case of prenatally detected sSMC(22).

OBJECTIVE: To screen the differentially methylated DNA sequences between mucosa
adjacent to colorectal cancer (MACC) and normal colonic mucosa.
METHODS: The methylated DNA sequences were enriched by methylation CpG islands
amplification (MCA), and the differentially methylated DNA sequences between MACC
and normal colonic mucosa were isolated by representational difference analysis
(RDA). Similarities between the separated fragments and the human genomic DNA
were analyzed with BLAST program system in GenBank. With the separated fragment
1A12 as probe, dot blot was used to study its distribution between RDA products
(No. 1-4 rounds), MACC (tester) and normal colonic mucosa(driver).
RESULTS: Twenty-five differentially methylated DNA sequences were obtained.
Preliminary studies indicated that 1A01 fragment was concerned with two different
genes (LOC256866 and CECR7), it was located in the first exon of CECR7. 1A12
fragment was located in 5 flanking region of GR6 gene. By dot blot with 1A12
probe, hybridized signals were detected in MCA product of MACC and RDA products
of No. 1-4 rounds, respectively. No signal was detected in MCA product of normal 
colonic mucosa.
CONCLUSION: The differentially methylated DNA sequences can be isolated
effectively between two different tissues with MCA coupled with RDA. Different
methylated DNA fragments exist between MACC and normal colonic mucosa and these
fragments may be concerned with colorectal cancer.

Three duplicons form a novel chimeric transcription unit in the pericentromeric
region of chromosome 22q11.

Pericentromeric regions of human chromosomes are preferential sites for the
integration of duplicated DNA, or "duplicons", which often contain gene
fragments. Although pericentromeric regions appear to be genomic junkyards, they 
could also be the birthplace of new genes with novel functions. We have
characterized a chimeric transcription unit (cat eye syndrome critical region
gene 7, CECR7) formed from three duplicons in the pericentromeric region of
chromosome 22q. CECR7 exons show similarity to sequences on chromosomes 2, 5, 7, 
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, and elsewhere on 22. Based on polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) analysis of CECR7 duplicon boundaries in various primate
species, and the sequence divergence between the human duplicons and their
putative ancestral human loci, CECR7 was probably formed before the separation of
macaque and is therefore older than most previously reported pericentromeric
duplicons. Expression of CECR7 was detected by RT-PCR in humans and gorilla
fibroblasts, but not orangutan, suggesting that expression did not result
immediately from the formation of this novel transcription unit, or that
expression was silenced in orangutan following its formation.

We have sequenced a 1.1-Mb region of human chromosome 22q containing the
dosage-sensitive gene(s) responsible for cat eye syndrome (CES) as well as the
450-kb homologous region on mouse chromosome 6. Fourteen putative genes were
identified within or adjacent to the human CES critical region (CESCR), including
three known genes (IL-17R, ATP6E, and BID) and nine novel genes, based on EST
identity. Two putative genes (CECR3 and CECR9) were identified, in the absence of
EST hits, by comparing segments of human and mouse genomic sequence around two
solitary amplified exons, thus showing the utility of comparative genomic
sequence analysis in identifying transcripts. Of the 14 genes, 10 were confirmed 
to be present in the mouse genomic sequence in the same order and orientation as 
in human. Absent from the mouse region of conserved synteny are CECR1, a
promising CES candidate gene from the center of the contig, neighboring CECR4,
and CECR7 and CECR8, which are located in the gene-poor proximal 400 kb of the
contig. This latter proximal region, located approximately 1 Mb from the
centromere, shows abundant duplicated gene fragments typical of pericentromeric
DNA. The margin of this region also delineates the boundary of conserved synteny 
between the CESCR and mouse chromosome 6. Because the proximal CESCR appears
abundant in duplicated segments and, therefore, is likely to be gene poor, we
consider the putative genes identified in the distal CESCR to represent the

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have an undefined role in the pathobiology of
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). These tumors are genetically and phenotypically
heterogeneous with transcriptome subtype-specific GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) that
adapt to the brain tumor microenvironment, including hypoxic niches. We
identified hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha-antisense RNA 2 (HIF1A-AS2) as a
subtype-specific hypoxia-inducible lncRNA, upregulated in mesenchymal GSCs. Its
deregulation affects GSC growth, self-renewal, and hypoxia-dependent molecular
reprogramming. Among the HIF1A-AS2 interactome, IGF2BP2 and DHX9 were identified 
as direct partners. This association was needed for maintenance of expression of 
their target gene, HMGA1. Downregulation of HIF1A-AS2 led to delayed growth of
mesenchymal GSC tumors, survival benefits, and impaired expression of HMGA1
in vivo. Our data demonstrate that HIF1A-AS2 contributes to GSCs' speciation and 
adaptation to hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment, acting directly through 
its interactome and targets and indirectly by modulating responses to hypoxic
stress depending on the subtype-specific genetic context.

BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recently shown to play
important regulatory roles in fundamental biological processes, and many of them 
are deregulated in several human cancers. LncRNA hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha 
antisense RNA-2 (HIF1A-AS2) is overexpressed in nonpapillary clear-cell renal
carcinomas and involved in cancer progression.
AIM: This study was to evaluate the expression of HIF1A-AS2 in gastric cancer
(GC) and further explore its biological function in GC cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used 
to detect the expression level of HIF1A-AS2 in GC tissues. The correlation of its
expression with clinicopathological features was analyzed. Area under receiver
operating characteristic curve (ROC(AUC)) was constructed to evaluate the
diagnostic value of HIF1A-AS2. Besides, tumor cell proliferation was assessed
following knockdown of HIF1A-AS2, by MTT and colony formation assay in vitro, and
tumor formation assay in a nude mouse model in vivo.
RESULTS: The expression of HIF1A-AS2 was upregulated in GC tumorous tissues
compared with the adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.001). Its overexpression was
correlated with TNM stages (P = 0.008), tumor invasion (P = 0.016), lymph node
metastasis (P = 0.042), and poor prognosis (P = 0.001). In addition, ROC(AUC) of 
HIF1A-AS2 was up to 0.673 (95 % CI 0.596-0.744, P < 0.001). Moreover, knockdown
of HIF1A-AS2 expression by siRNA could inhibit cell proliferation in vitro and
tumorigenesis in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: HIF1A-AS2 is overexpressed in GC and may play a pivotal role in
tumor cell proliferation. It can be used as a potential diagnostic and prognostic
biomarker for GC.

Role of Pnn in alternative splicing of a specific subset of lncRNAs of the
corneal epithelium.

Medicine, Gainesville, FL.

PURPOSE: GG-H whole transcriptome array analysis suggested involvement of PININ
(PNN) in the alternative splicing of multiple long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). To 
further investigate PNN's role in regulating the alternative splicing of lncRNAs 
in a corneal epithelial context, we performed detailed analyses for detecting and
identifying alternatively spliced lncRNAs.
METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from PNN knockdown human corneal epithelial
(HCET) cells or Pnn-deficient mouse corneas, and subjected to real-time-PCR
(RT-PCR) assays, and the alternatively spliced lncRNAs were counted.
Alternatively spliced lncRNAs were detected with in situ hybridization with
variant-specific RNA probes on human cornea sections.
RESULTS: Our analysis uncovered PNN's impact on the transcript levels of several 
lncRNAs including Linc00085 and HAS2-AS1. Interestingly, a mouse ortholog of
HAS2-AS1, Has2as, clearly exhibited a differential splicing pattern among three
major splice variants in the Pnn-deficient mouse cornea. The sequence analyses
and quantification of splice variants of candidate lncRNAs, including
RP11-295B20.2, RP11-18I14.1, and RP11-322M19.1, demonstrated complex
configuration of their splicing changes, with a significant impact of PNN on the 
process. Knockdown of PNN in HCET cells led to specific changes in the inclusion 
of multiple cassette exons as well as in the use of alternative splice sites in
RP11-322M19.1 and RP11-18I14.1, resulting in considerable net changes in the
ratio between the splice variants. Finally, in situ hybridization analyses
revealed the presence of RP11-295G20.2 in the nuclei of corneal epithelial cells,
but not in the stromal cells of the human cornea, while RP11-322M19.1 was present
in epithelial and non-epithelial cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest PNN's role in the alternative splicing of a
specific subset of lncRNAs might have a significant impact on the corneal
epithelium.

Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-enriched subtype
breast cancer is associated with a more aggressive phenotype and shorter survival
time. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have essential roles in tumorigenesis and
occupy a central place in cancer progression. Notably, few studies have focused
on the dysregulation of LncRNAs in the HER-2-enriched subtype breast cancer. In
this study, we analyzed the expression profile of LncRNAs and mRNAs in this
particular subtype of breast cancer.
METHODS: Seven pairs of HER-2-enriched subtype breast cancer and normal tissue
were sequenced. We screened out differently expressed genes and measured the
correlation of the expression levels of dysregulated LncRNAs and HER-2 by
Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis. Gene ontology analysis and pathway
analysis were used to understand the biological roles of these differently
expressed genes. Pathway act network and coexpression network were constructed.
RESULTS: More than 1,300 LncRNAs and 2,800 mRNAs, which were significantly
differently expressed, were identified. Among these LncRNAs, AFAP1-AS1 was the
most dysregulated LncRNA, while ORM2 was the most dysregulated mRNA. LOC100288637
had the highest positive correlation coefficient of 0.93 with HER-2, while
RPL13P5 had the highest negative correlation coefficient of -0.87. The pathway
act network showed that MAPK signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway,
metabolic pathways, cell cycle, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton were highly 
related with HER-2-enriched subtype breast cancer. Coexpression network
recognized LINC00636, LINC01405, ADARB2-AS1, ST8SIA6-AS1, LINC00511, and
DPP10-AS1 as core genes.
CONCLUSION: These results analyze the functions of LncRNAs and provide useful
information for exploring candidate therapeutic targets and new molecular
biomarkers for HER-2-enriched subtype breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of DNA
methylation in placenta in relation to maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy 
and examined whether smoking-induced changes lead to low birthweight.
METHODS: DNA methylation in placenta was measured using the Illumina
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in 179 participants from the INfancia y Medio
Ambiente (INMA) birth cohort. Methylation levels across 431 311 CpGs were tested 
for differential methylation between smokers and non-smokers in pregnancy. We
took forward three top-ranking loci for further validation and replication by
bisulfite pyrosequencing using data of 248 additional participants of the INMA
cohort. We examined the association of methylation at smoking-associated loci
with birthweight by applying a mediation analysis and a two-sample Mendelian
randomization approach.
RESULTS: Fifty CpGs were differentially methylated in placenta between smokers
and non-smokers during pregnancy [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05]. We
validated and replicated differential methylation at three top-ranking loci:
cg27402634 located between LINC00086 and LEKR1, a gene previously related to
birthweight in genome-wide association studies; cg20340720 (WBP1L); and
cg25585967 and cg12294026 (TRIO). Dose-response relationships with maternal urine
cotinine concentration during pregnancy were confirmed. Differential methylation 
at cg27402634 explained up to 36% of the lower birthweight in the offspring of
smokers (Sobel P-value < 0.05). A two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis
provided evidence that decreases in methylation levels at cg27402634 lead to
decreases in birthweight.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel loci differentially methylated in placenta in
relation to maternal smoking during pregnancy. Adverse effects of maternal
smoking on birthweight of the offspring may be mediated by alterations in the
placental methylome.

Exfoliation syndrome (XFS) is a common, age-related, systemic fibrillinopathy. It
greatly increases risk of exfoliation glaucoma (XFG), a major worldwide cause of 
irreversible blindness. Coding variants in the lysyl oxidase-like 1 (LOXL1) gene 
are strongly associated with XFS in all studied populations, but a functional
role for these variants has not been established. To identify additional
candidate functional variants, we sequenced the entire LOXL1 genomic locus (∼40
kb) in 50 indigenous, black South African XFS cases and 50 matched controls. The 
variants with the strongest evidence of association were located in a
well-defined 7-kb region bounded by the 3'-end of exon 1 and the adjacent region 
of intron 1 of LOXL1. We replicated this finding in US Caucasian (91 cases/1031
controls), German (771 cases/1365 controls) and Japanese (1484 cases/1188
controls) populations. The region of peak association lies upstream of LOXL1-AS1,
a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) encoded on the opposite strand of LOXL1. We show
that this region contains a promoter and, importantly, that the strongly
associated XFS risk alleles in the South African population are functional
variants that significantly modulate the activity of this promoter. LOXL1-AS1
expression is also significantly altered in response to oxidative stress in human
lens epithelial cells and in response to cyclic mechanical stress in human
Schlemm's canal endothelial cells. Taken together, these findings support a
functional role for the LOXL1-AS1 lncRNA in cellular stress response and suggest 
that dysregulation of its expression by genetic risk variants plays a key role in
XFS pathogenesis.

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a genetic disorder of neural crest development. It
is also believed that epigenetic changes plays a role in the progression of this 
disease. Here we show that the MIR143 host gene (MIR143HG), the precursor of
miR-143 and miR-145, decreased cell proliferation and migration and forms a
negative feedback loop with RBM24 in HSCR. As RBM24 mRNA is a target of miR-143, 
upregulation of RBM24 upon an increase in the level of MIR143HG could be
attributed to sequestration of miR-143 by MIR143HG (sponge effect). The RBM24
protein was shown to bind to MIR143HG, and subsequently, accelerated its
degradation by destabilizing its transcript and facilitating its interaction with
Ago2, thus forming a negative feedback between MIR143HG and RBM24. In addition,
experiments using siRNA against DROSHA indicated that RBM24 could promote the
biogenesis of miR-143. This feedback loop we describe here represents a novel
mode of autoregulation, with implications in HSCR pathogenesis.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recently shown to play an important role
in gene regulation and normal cellular functions, and disease processes. However,
despite the overwhelming number of lncRNAs identified to date, little is known
about their role in cancer for vast majority of them. The present study aims to
determine whether lncRNAs can serve as prognostic markers in human breast cancer.
We interrogated the breast invasive carcinoma dataset of the Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) at the cBioPortal consisting of ~ 1,000 cases. Among 2,730 lncRNAs
analyzed, 577 lncRNAs had alterations ranging from 1% to 32% frequency, which
include mutations, alterations of copy number and RNA expression. We found that
deregulation of 11 lncRNAs, primarily due to copy number alteration, is
associated with poor overall survival. At RNA expression level, upregulation of 4
lncRNAs (LINC00657, LINC00346, LINC00654 and HCG11) was associated with poor
overall survival. A third signature consists of 9 lncRNAs (LINC00705, LINC00310, 
LINC00704, LINC00574, FAM74A3, UMODL1-AS1, ARRDC1-AS1, HAR1A, and LINC00323) and 
their upregulation can predict recurrence. Finally, we selected LINC00657 to
determine their role in breast cancer, and found that LINC00657 knockout
significantly suppresses tumor cell growth and proliferation, suggesting that it 
plays an oncogenic role. Together, these results highlight the clinical
significance of lncRNAs, and thus, these lncRNAs may serve as prognostic markers 
for breast cancer.
