	<string>Blood-Retinal Barrier Breakdown Review:Molecular basis of the inner blood-retinal barrier and its breakdown in diabetic macular edema and other pathological conditions (2013)

ï¿¼

Two mechanisms for transport across endothelial layer of retinal capillaries:

The paracellular route restricts passage of solutes larger than 3 nm in radius and is the preferred pathway for water and small water-soluble compounds
Inter- endothelial cell junctions are complexes consisting of tight junc- tions, adherens junctions and gap junctions
3.1.2. The transcellular pathway: endothelial transcytosis
Transcytosis, a concept first introduced by Nicolae Simionescu (1979), is the transport of molecules across endothelial cells via specialized plasmalemmal vesicles, now termed caveolae.




Proteins involved in transcellular pathway include 

	caveolin-1 (structural component)
	trafficking controlled by
		VAMP-2 (vesicle-associated membrane protein)
		NSF
		SNAP-25
		PLVAP

Growth factors involved in BRB loss:

VEGF-A
TGF-Beta
PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) - knockout less to reduced pericyte
	coverage and vascular abnormalities

TGF-Beta is complex case, as systemic inhibition of TGF-beta leads to vascular leakage (indicating protective role), but can also increase permeability in vitro through 

	MMP9
	SMAD2 - mediated activation of 
	RhoA

PKC-Beta is downstream mediator of VEGF, implicated in vascular permeability


Hypoxia is involved in BRB breakdown 

	HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor, TF involved with 
		VEGF
		GLUT1 (glucose transporter)
		EPO-1
		GAPDH



TNF-alpha is a potential target for preventing BRB breakdown (why?)

Molecular mechanisms of tight junction loss (paracellular permeability):
	Occludin
	claudin-5
		both down regulated when VEGF introduced as model of diabetic
		retinopathy in rat eye; VEGF activates downstream proteins incl
		PKC and src-family kinases, leads to ubiquitiniation and loss of 
		occludin

Molecular mechanisms of adherens junction loss:

	VE-cadherin and beta-catenin are down-regulated by VEGF.
		(HOWEVER, increased phosphorylation/degradation of these proteins
		can lead to permeability, not just decreased expression)
	PEDF inibits VEGF-induced permeability

Molecular mechanism of transcytosis contribution to permeability
	CAV-1 upregulstion (incl by VEGF)
	PLVAP/PV-1 strongly assoc with permeability
	ANG-2 also (induces migration of pericytes)

	so here is more detailed story based on Fig.10 in paper: Angiopoeitin 1 (ang-1) is produced by pericytes, binds to TIE-2 receptor in endothelial cell, leads to tightening of tight junctions and adherens junctions and production of PDGF-beta , which leads to tightening of adhesion contacts between pericytes and endothelial cells. Ang-2 can compete with Ang-1, but does NOT activate TIE-2; result is that tight junctions are loosened, PDGF-beta is down regulated, pericytes may detach, VE cadherin is phosphorylated and internalized, increased vascular permeability. 

TGF-beta is unregulated by pericyte-endothelial interaction, acts to increase BRB integrity

Extracellular matrix protein production is increased in BRB breakdown, such 
	collagen IV
	laminin-beta,gamma	
	fibronectin
as well as pro-fibrotic proteins 
	CTGF
	TIMP-1

Glial cells in pathology can activate and over express VEGF, MMPs and TNF-alpha, inducing angiogenesis
